          "body": "<p>For a few hours at least last Sunday, the Metropolitan police and its embattled commissioner appeared on the brink. Assailed from all sides over its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/13/as-the-sun-set-they-came-in-solidarity-and-to-pay-tribute-to-sarah-everard\">handling of the Sarah Everard vigil</a> on Clapham Common in London, there seemed every chance Dame Cressida Dick would have to quit the force she has been in charge of since 2017.</p> <p>Instead she survived, as the Home Office and then Downing Street eventually signalled they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/15/sarah-everard-vigil-organiser-met-chief-should-not-resign-cressida-dick\">retained confidence in her</a>, despite the disturbing scenes of her officers manhandling women.</p> <p>But the support she received from the home secretary, Priti Patel, immediately raised questions about what role, if any, she played behind the scenes in the run-up to vigil on Saturday evening.</p> <p>A memo leaked to the Guardian offers some clues.</p> <p>On Friday, as the police and the vigil’s organisers were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/12/organisers-sarah-everard-vigil-challenge-met-decision-ban-reclaim-these-streets\">heading to court</a> over the legality of such an event, a message was sent to all police chiefs making Patel’s position clear.</p> <p>She wanted them to stop people gathering at vigils. She also promised she would personally urge people not to gather – but she never did.</p> <p>Though the police are operationally independent, the home secretary had made her views clear – which made her criticisms of the way officers broke up the event particularly galling, according to some police chiefs who spoke to the Guardian.</p> <p>As a result, some chiefs feel policing was “hung out to dry” when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/mar/13/reclaim-these-streets-vigils-womens-safety-uk-latest-updates?page=with:block-604d35e78f083aee44b79a52#block-604d35e78f083aee44b79a52\">criticised</a> pictures of officers manhandling women at Clapham Common, rebuked the Met commissioner and then ordered an inquiry.</p> <p>One chief constable told the Guardian the message from Patel and the government ahead of the vigils had been clear, that a ban on gatherings had to be enforced.</p> <p>Tensions are now running high between police and ministers. A government source hit back at any complaints from within policing, saying that “pinning women to the floor and dragging them away from Clapham Common bandstand was an independent operational decision” made by the police themselves.</p> <p>Police chiefs and the policing minister, Kit Malthouse, held a meeting on Friday morning in which he supported a ban. Following those discussions a memo was sent to all police chiefs in England, from Operation Talla, the codename for the national police coordination effort for the Covid pandemic.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned what the document said and how it revealed what police feel Patel expected them to do if people gathered to mourn the 33-year-old marketing executive. </p> <p>Entitled “Vigils following the murder investigation of Sarah Everard”, it begins “Dear Chief constables” and advises “early engagement” with the organisers of the planned vigils.</p> <p>The document from the National Police Chiefs’ Council then reads: “We understand the strength of feeling. Covid regulations do not permit large gatherings.</p> <p>“This issue has been discussed with the policing minister this morning who is supportive of our position. In support of this, the home secretary will also be issuing a message to the public later today that will discourage people gathering in person.”</p> <p>The document then states what police were expected to do, having declared this position had government support. It says: “People should conduct their vigil using alternative means and in accordance with the law.</p> <p>“Police must take a consistent approach and cannot waive the regulations for any one type of gathering.”</p> <p>There was no doubt, said senior policing sources, of what the government wanted to be done as forces wrestled with how to act. One chief said: “Chiefs would have thought there was a clear understanding that the government was requiring us to enforce the regulations.”</p> <p>What ministers saw unfold on Saturday, however, was beyond their expectations. Patel tweeted comments saying the scenes of women being dragged off by male police officers were “upsetting”.</p> <p>She demanded a report and then on Sunday is said to have given Dick a dressing down, saying her explanation was unsatisfactory and ordering an inquiry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pritipatel/status/1370856092062912512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Some of the footage circulating online from the vigil in Clapham is upsetting. I have asked the Metropolitan Police for a full report on what happened.<br><br>My thoughts remain with Sarah’s family and friends at this terrible time.</p>&mdash; Priti Patel (@pritipatel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pritipatel/status/1370856092062912512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 13, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>On Sunday, the Home Office released a statement that said: “The home secretary has read the report provided by the Metropolitan police and feels there are still questions to be answered. In the interests of ensuring public confidence in the police, earlier this afternoon the home secretary asked Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary to conduct a ‘lessons learned’ review into the policing of the event at Clapham Common.”</p> <p>HMIC is a policing watchdog that independently assesses the effectiveness and efficiency of police forces.</p> <p>Later on Sunday, Patel let it be known she had “full confidence” in the commissioner, which followed a similar declaration from the prime minister. The inquiry will be led by Matt Parr and is due within a fortnight. He authored a controversial report on protest published last week.</p> <p>On Monday, Patel appeared in the Commons and told MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/mar/15/priti-patel-told-police-people-could-lay-flowers-at-sarah-everard-vigil\">she had been in contact with police</a> before the vigils, especially Dick, but would only say she had said laying the flowers at vigils would be permissible.</p> <p>It was not the full backing police had hoped for. Another source said the condemnation by Patel after the clashes had angered police: “The line from them was the law is the law. Chiefs believed that there was agreement that there would not be gatherings and no special favours and that the home secretary would say something on Friday or Saturday.</p> <p>“She reneged on an undertaking given to them [the chiefs] and then rubbished the commissioner. They feel they have been hung out to dry, when they were expecting her [the home secretary] to align herself and the government with the approach they had agreed.</p> <p>“They were told to apply the law which meant no gatherings because of Covid.”</p> <p>A Whitehall source defended Patel: “Of course the government will believe the law should be enforced. How it is enforced is a matter for the police.</p> <p>“As the government’s statement made clear the vigil was not able to go ahead within the confines of Covid regulations and we encouraged people to participate in the vigil whilst respecting the guidelines.</p> <p>“The decision to start pinning women to the floor and dragging them away from Clapham Common bandstand was an independent operational decision made by them, for which they will have to explain to the inspectorate.”</p> <p>The Met said it only acted at Clapham Common when the crowds became dense and it believed Covid rules were being breached.</p> <p>But Patel’s sympathy for the women at the vigil was undermined by her own legislative agenda. The government’s police, crime, sentencing and courts bill was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/16/bill-that-curtails-ability-to-protest-in-uk-passes-its-second-reading\">voted through its second reading in parliament</a>, moving it a step closer to becoming law this week.</p> <p>The bill contains measures that significantly increase the powers police have to deal with protests. Critics, including women who attended the Clapham Common vigil, fear it will curtail the right to protest.</p> <p>On Monday night, after Patel had appeared in the House of Commons, further protests over the bill, entwined with action in response to the death of Everard, took place in central London.</p> <p>In response the government suggested plainclothes police officers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/16/project-vigilant-what-are-the-measures-boris-johnson-announced\">could patrol bars and nightclubs</a> around the country and pledged to double funding to the Safer Streets fund in an effort to take “immediate steps to provide further reassurance” for women and girls.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Met police continued to say it understood its actions upset people but would not apologise. The force’s deputy commissioner, Sir Stephen House, told the London assembly he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/17/met-deputy-says-he-cant-apologise-for-officers-over-sarah-everard-vigil\">“can’t apologise for my officers”</a> over their handling of the vigil.</p> <p>And despite facing calls for her resignation, Dick remains in place. A Whitehall source said she had a “good working relationship” with the home secretary.</p>"

Knowingly misleading parliament would be a clear breach of the ministerial code and a resignation matter.</p> <p>“I’m in no doubt that if a minister, regardless of party or personality, is found to have misled parliament and breached the code then the code is very clear: that the minister is expected to resign”, said Sarwar.</p> <p>Starmer added: “Obviously, the focus is very much on the individual Nicola Sturgeon but actually it’s bigger than that. It’s about the integrity of the Scottish parliament, the integrity of the office of first minister and standards in public life. The code is explicit and the expectation has to be – if there is a breach of the code – then there should be a resignation.”</p> <p>At a joint press briefing on Friday morning to mark Starmer’s first visit to Scotland since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/feb/27/anas-sarwar-wins-scottish-labour-leadership-election\">Sarwar was elected</a> Scottish Labour leader last month, both stopped short of calling for Sturgeon to resign, saying it was important not to pre-judge the inquiry’s full report, which will be published next Tuesday.</p> <p>Asked about the significance of the committee’s conclusion that Sturgeon did not mislead them “knowingly”, Sarwar said: “A breach is a breach, and misleading of the parliament is a misleading of the parliament.”</p> <p>Starmer added: “The first minister was absolutely clear in the foreword [that she wrote] to the code that she would lead by example and follow the letter and spirit of the code. Obviously there will be technical issues that may come up next week, but the spirit of the code is really important because that goes to the integrity of the office of first minister.”</p> <p>Sarwar added that the leaking of the committee’s partial conclusions was “completely unacceptable” and risked distracting from the fundamental principles of the inquiry.</p>"

          "body": "<p>Should we be suspicious of the idea that fiction can help us to live meaningful lives? After all, as Plato observed (via a fictionalised Socrates), Homer’s stories were composed to stir and entertain rather than to instruct us. They may be a lot of fun, but they have nothing to tell us about living well. How could fictional characters, shadowy beings who exist only in words, offer any meaningful purchase on the all too solid problems of our daily lives?</p> <p>If we try to enlist the help of novels by extracting rules and hacks and counsel from them, we will probably prove Plato right. Novels, or at least the ones worth reading, draw us in not by offering moral instruction or practical guidance, but by helping us to see ourselves in all our strangeness and complexity.</p> <p>Having spent a large portion of my life reading fiction and practising psychotherapy, this strikes me as the essential overlap between the two. Each gets us to listen to the nuances and rhythms of human experience, to make ourselves available to the unsuspected thoughts, feelings and desires murmuring below the surface. Listening is the engine of curiosity, and so of change and growth.</p> <p>Like the psychoanalyst, the novelist can’t cure us of error and illusion and shouldn’t try. To cite Philip Roth’s Nathan Zuckerman, “That’s how we know we’re alive: we’re wrong.” But psychoanalysis and literature can help us to experience those errors and illusions from the inside rather than view them from on high, to enter deeply enough into the world of the person who made them to begin to understand why.</p> <p><strong>*</strong></p> <p>As my virtual consulting room reminds me hourly, listening feels like a precious commodity at the moment, when our curiosity is perpetually drowned by fear. When the first lockdown began, it struck me that the new restrictions on our physical freedom were being mirrored in a kind of psychic restriction. The people I listened to would often sound locked down imaginatively, pinned to the spot by the force and immediacy of their worries.</p> <p>And the pandemic hasn’t been the only thing menacing our capacity to listen. Toxic political divisions, stoked by demagogues and amplified in media bubbles, have turned those who think differently to us into the deadliest of enemies. The willingness and courage to listen to other voices can rarely have seemed in such short supply.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b5421a0eaa5498c8b25b61874d18f94877b66ab7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5421a0eaa5498c8b25b61874d18f94877b66ab7/0_0_5117_6116/837.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration for Alice in Wonderland by Sir John Tenniel, 1871.\" width=\"837\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration for <em>Alice in Wonderlan</em><em>d</em> by Sir John Tenniel, 1871.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Walker Art Library/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This may be one way in which fiction can help. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/20/lewis-carroll-alice-in-wonderland-adventures-150-years\">Think of Alice</a>, wandering through the anarchic and disturbing dream worlds of Wonderland and Looking-Glass with such easy curiosity. However violently the laws of physics and language and logic may bend and break, Alice’s level of perturbation never seems to go beyond mild surprise or impatience. The White Queen can metamorphose into a sheep who doubles as the clerk of a shop whose sale items float away the moment Alice looks at them; “Things flow about so here!” she remarks, as though she’s strolled into the park on an unexpectedly blowy day.</p> <p>The boundary separating reality from illusion is much more porous for a child than an adult. A child’s imaginative life seeps into the reality around her; even in waking life, Alice’s kitten plays chess. Her favourite phrase, “Let’s pretend!”, is one most of us abandon somewhere on the road to adulthood, and that some are deprived of the chance to utter in the first place. For the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, this is a source of many of the malaises of adult life; if we’ve not known what it is to pretend, to experience the permeability of real and imaginary worlds, we cannot feel properly alive.</p> <p>Alice offers us a kind of masterclass in aliveness. Ambling through the monstrous landscapes of her dreaming mind’s creation, she never shrinks in horror or cries in fear, but greets whoever and whatever she meets in a spirit of generous acceptance. Caterpillars who smoke hookahs, oversized talking eggs who argue semantics: other bodies and voices are never so other that she declines to open her curious ears to them.</p> <p>An expansive imaginative life like Alice’s is rooted in the inner security that comes from being loved from birth, as another great fictional girl, Jane Eyre, confirms. At the point <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/12/reading-jane-eyre-charlotte-bronte\">Jane Eyre</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/12/reading-jane-eyre-charlotte-bronte\"> </a>begins, Jane has been stranded in the hostile confines of her Aunt Reed’s home. Charlotte Brontë takes pains to let us know that this hasn’t been her only emotional experience, that baby Jane’s arrival was received with joy by her birth parents before they succumbed to typhus, that she had been “a great favourite” of her adoptive Uncle Reed.</p> <p>Jane’s subjection to the loveless regimes of Gateshead Hall and Lowood School has been preceded by the love of her earliest carers, implanting in her a belief in her right to life and selfhood and a fierce protectiveness towards her own imaginative freedom. In fact, she spends much of her young life yearning and fighting to regain the love she received in infancy.</p> <p>After suffering public humiliation from the sadistic headmaster Brocklehurst, she tells her friend Helen Burns: “to gain some affection from you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest – ”.</p> <p>Jane is effectively saying that the worst imaginable pain is preferable to the void of lovelessness. She would rather be full of a pain she can feel than emptied of the basic conditions for feeling anything. Helen, who hushes her wild talk and counsels stoic endurance of her tormentors, eventually succumbs to the outbreak of typhus that Jane survives. Jane fights for the life Helen surrenders because, unlike Helen, she knows her life is worth fighting for, a knowledge that is the very meaning of resilience.</p> <p><strong>*</strong></p> <p>Jane carries in herself a kernel of parental love that grounds her determination and desire. She makes an interesting contrast in this regard with Frances, the protagonist of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/01/conversations-with-friends-by-sally-rooney-review\">Sally Rooney’s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/01/conversations-with-friends-by-sally-rooney-review\">Conversations With Friends</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/01/conversations-with-friends-by-sally-rooney-review\">.</a> Both as a couple and as parents, Frances’s mother and father are defined by a kind of emotional evasiveness, an inability to show the love they feel, for one another and for their child. Their withholding tendencies come to shape Frances’s conception of herself as “emotionally cold”, too distant from herself to know how or what she feels.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rooney reads as an unlikely 21st-century companion to DH Lawrence, the literary high priest of emotional intensity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From the beginning of the novel, Frances lets us know just how much energy she invests in not giving herself away. We meet her in the back of a taxi, “already preparing compliments and certain facial expressions to make myself seem charming”. A little later, watching a shirtless Nick, the older man soon to become her lover, act on stage, she feels “a sting of self-consciousness, as if the audience had all turned at this moment to observe my reaction”. In each of these moments, Frances can access her inner self only by way of a long-winded detour through the eyes of others: glimpsing Nick’s muscled torso, she feels not her eye on him, but their eyes on her on him.</p> <p>Perpetually at war with her own feelings, Frances gives us insight into sexual love as a region of danger, raging with volatility and turbulence, violent and sudden fluctuations between joy and pain, affection and rage. Unable to bear the sheer intensity of her emotional life, she obfuscates her own feelings, deceiving herself as much as others. She hears messages from her interior but is unsure whether she can trust them. She is a fine companion for our own feelings of uncertainty and self-doubt.</p> <p>In her portrayal of love as a kind of excess of feeling, too much for body and soul to bear, Rooney reads as an unlikely 21st-century companion to DH Lawrence, the literary high priest of emotional intensity.</p> <p>Such ideas have been particularly on my mind lately, as I’ve listened to men and women tell me of their marital struggles in lockdown. How are they to bear the unbroken intimacy enforced by their confinement, they ask, channelling Dorothea Brooke’s lament in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/28/middlemarch-george-eliot-martin-amis-as-byatt\">Middlemarch</a></em>: “Marriage is so unlike anything else. There is something even awful in the nearness it brings.”</p> <p>Our culture encourages us to think of coupledom as an expansion of our selfhood and our world; but at an everyday level, the proximity of another person can feel like a perpetually resented obstacle to self-fulfilment, a constriction of our possibilities. This experience of marriage is brought to distressing life in countless great novels: <em>Middlemarch</em>; <em>Anna Karenina</em>; or the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/30/chris-kraus-ive-never-had-much-talent-for-making-things-up-i-love-dick-interview\"> experimental writer Chris Kraus’</a>s 2006 contribution to the genre, aptly titled <em>Torpor.</em></p> <p><em>Torpor</em> follows its couple – protagonist Sylvie and her partner Jerome – around Europe in 1991, as they bicker with a kind of genial sado-masochism about Jerome’s obsession with the Holocaust (and her failure to understand it), his teenage daughter’s hostility to Sylvie (and Sylvie’s desperate need for her acceptance ), and his refusal to let her take the odd cab (and her “American brat’s” sense of entitlement to one), all the while pursuing a doomed plan to adopt a Romanian orphan.</p> <p>Kraus brings out the comedy of the “awful nearness” of coupledom, the way it traps its participants in torturous and oddly gratifying loops of the same arguments and resentments. Marriage sets the same trap as Yossarian’s Catch-22 – in marriage as in war, the way out is an illusion that pulls you right back in: “The only means of escaping from the torpor of their lives would have been to have a baby. A baby would have forced them into some momentum. But they’ll never have a child for exactly the same reasons that Jerome won’t let her take a taxi.”</p> <p>The members of a couple, in other words, are liable to obtain obscure gratification from their awful nearness to one another, to relish getting stuck in the torpor of their life together. So what would it mean to make that nearness less awful?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Beneath the familiar surface of marital bickering is a violent revolt against the pressures of intimacy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Few writers have thought about this question more deeply than DH Lawrence. One chapter of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/14/100-best-novels-the-rainbow-dh-lawrence-robert-mccrum\">The Rainbow</a></em> begins with the extended, voluntary confinement of a young newlywed couple, Anna and Will Brangwen, in their cottage and, for the most part, their marital bed.</p> <p>The problem is that the couple can’t be forever immune to the encroachments and pressures of the world outside, the need (as Will puts it to himself) “to get up in the morning and wash oneself and be a decent social being”. Anna feels a sudden and irresistible urge for “a real outburst of housework”, which transforms Will at a stroke from languid love-god to nuisance: “‘Can’t you do anything’ she said, as if to a child, impatiently. ‘Can’t you do your wood-work?’” leaving Will furious at his sudden superfluousness.</p> <p>What could be more ordinary, banal even? Versions of this row are repeated in households everywhere, all the time: woman gets busy, man stands about uselessly, woman becomes irritable, man retreats into a bubble of self-pity and hurt pride. If you’re in a long-term partnership and don’t recognise some version of this dispute, your relationship is either a shining example of domestic cooperation or a ticking time-bomb.</p> <p>Lawrence’s brilliance lies in his revelation of this little scene as a skirmish in an ongoing war of unconscious forces. Beneath the familiar surface of marital bickering is a violent revolt against the pressures of intimacy. Anna feels an irritation “beyond bearing”, unleashing in Will a rage of his own, “black and electric”: “He seemed a dark, almost evil thing, pursuing her, hanging on to her, burdening her … ‘Can’t you <em>do</em> something?’”</p> <p>It’s not about the feet getting in the way of the vacuum cleaner. It’s more that the resulting twinge of irritation touches the edge of something bigger and much more frightening: all my external and internal space is shared with this person. Everything that happens to them happens to me. Everywhere I turn, they’re there. It’s not just the hallway carpet; they are <em>always in the way</em>.</p> <p>But this is the essential paradox of intimacy: in intensifying our closeness to another, we not only make them more familiar to us; we come alive to their strangeness and irreducible difference. Real closeness must involve the recognition of the other’s need for separateness or else be mired in tragicomic torpor. This is the substance of Lawrence’s dark and risky optimism about love and marriage, and it strikes me as holding special resonance for couples living through lockdown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25ce578a19116e7f117bcbe5b7f81481b022b5ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25ce578a19116e7f117bcbe5b7f81481b022b5ff/0_14_1798_1079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vanessa Redgrave as Clarissa Dalloway (1997).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vanessa Redgrave as Clarissa Dalloway (1997).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>*</strong></p> <p>Of course, there is more than one kind of marital problem. If some people complain of the claustrophobic intimacy of marriage, others, perhaps especially if they are older, will speak of a gulf in contact, of a loneliness that their partner’s presence only amplifies. How do we live with such emotional disappointment as we move into the second half of life?</p> <p>Few novels offer a richer response to this question than Virginia Woolf’s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/13/celebrate-dallowday-mrs-dalloway-virginia-woolf\">Mrs Dalloway</a></em>, her account of a sunny day in the life of the disappointed wife of a Tory MP. Long past childbearing, celibate and cloistered in a single bedroom, Clarissa experiences “the oddest sense of being herself invisible; unseen; unknown”. She is fearfully attuned to “the dwindling of life”, a reference not only to the daily contracting lifespan, but to the draining away of its sensory vividness.</p> <p>But the paradox of <em>Mrs Dalloway</em> is that it is in precisely this unpromising inner landscape that we can find remarkable experiential riches. The desperate, inchoate “unhappiness” Clarissa feels is only the warp to the weft of the overwhelming “love of life” that can just as easily overwhelm her. Even her loss of youthful energy and hope becomes an eerie kind of joy, as in this beautiful passage close to the end of the novel:</p> <blockquote> <p>Odd, incredible: she had never been so happy. Nothing could be slow enough; nothing last too long. No pleasure could equal, she thought, straightening the chairs, pushing in one book on the shelf, this having done with the triumphs of youth, lost herself in the process of living, to find it, with a shock of delight, as the sun rose, as the day sank.</p> </blockquote> <p>What Clarissa means by the joy of “having done with the triumphs of youth” is a sense of happiness no longer being projected into an endlessly deferred, elusive future; suddenly, fleetingly but unmistakably, it’s right here, waiting for us in the faces of the people and things around us.</p> <p>This strikes me as a fitting wisdom for our indefinite confinement. There is no comfort for the lives and material security and freedom lost to the pandemic. But buried in these losses is a gain of sorts: the chance to stop searching frantically for meaning and pleasure everywhere else and find it where we are.</p> <p>Novels can show us how to live not by instruction but by the example of the generous, expansive curiosity they extend to the world and everything in it.</p>"

          "body": "<p>The government’s roadmap suggests that a return to live music is on the horizon but, thanks to a combination of a huge backlog of gigs, continuing global Covid infections, and unclear conditions for reopening, musicians, bookers, promoters, and club owners say it is far from certain.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Nicola Sturgeon announced that indoor and outdoor events could return in Scotland from 17 May, subject to capacity restraints. In England, performances are scheduled to return from the same date, with limited capacities, and nightclubs will reopen no earlier than 21 June. Anton Lockwood, a director at leading live music promoter DHP, says: “That’s all very well, but we’re really waiting to hear what the conditions of opening will be. The worry is that we’ll get lumbered with something that is unworkable.”</p> <p>For Lockwood, “unworkable” includes rumoured lateral flow testing for audiences (“it costs quite a bit of money, and where would we do it? In the street?”) and reduced, or socially distanced, capacities for concerts. “If I’m making an offer on a show at Nottingham’s Rock City, it’s based on selling 1,900 tickets. If I can only sell 400, it doesn’t add up. We wouldn’t be making anything like enough money to exist.”</p> <p>The same applies to some of the UK’s largest venues. James Harrison of ASM Global, which manages the AO Arena (formerly Manchester Arena), confirms that with significantly reduced capacity, “we would need to host 400% more events to bring us anywhere close to where our business needs to be.”</p> <p>Emma Bownes is vice president in venue programming at AEG Europe, and manages the booking diary at the O2 Arena, the UK’s second-largest indoor venue after the AO Arena. She says that with social distancing implemented, the O2’s capacity drops from 17,500 to 4,700. “It’s not viable. You can’t pay a US artist to come over for that.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"816ccf16910f7ec7157cc973da860ff0c72660c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/816ccf16910f7ec7157cc973da860ff0c72660c7/0_0_2048_1365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Country2Country festival at the O2 Arena.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Country2Country festival at the O2 Arena.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Dyson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moreover, for venues of this size, it’s not just about the UK being open for business. “If you’re looking on our website as a fan, and you’ve got a ticket for a gig in October, you’d probably think: surely I can go to that,” Bownes says. “But that artist is probably due to play arenas across the US in the summer, and then go across Europe. If a few of those dates become unviable, then the tour loses money and they’ll reschedule. The margins are just so small.”</p> <p>Rescheduling a big tour is difficult for the artist and venue alike. Bownes’s team has rebooked more than 80 arena shows at least twice, as lockdown rules continue to change. This cascade of changing dates is causing a knock-on effect: the O2 already has as many bookings for 2022 as it would do halfway through a normal year. “We’ve never been this busy, and our venue has never been so empty,” Bownes says.</p> <p>This concert pile-up makes it difficult for venues to juggle artists’ and audiences’ requirements, for instance in matching new dates with the same days of the week. “People with weekend tickets might be coming in from out of town, and we don’t want to make it so they can’t come,” she explains. But it is also causing artists themselves a great deal of concern.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b2b36e041831bdf7abb739c4fe895aa42c351b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b2b36e041831bdf7abb739c4fe895aa42c351b3/0_0_5806_3863/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Public Service Broadcasting performing at the Royal Albert Hall in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Public Service Broadcasting performing at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Watkins/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>J Willgoose of UK electronic music group Public Service Broadcasting says they booked their late-2021 tour well over a year ago, and even then they noticed an unusual level of competition. “The whole industry is competing for the same limited resources: venues, dates, crowds, crew.”</p> <p>Rou Reynolds, frontman of rock band Enter Shikari, who reached No 2 in the album chart last year, agrees. “It’s hard enough at the best of times, stringing dates together that route well. But now we’ve got every artist wanting – or perhaps needing, by way of financial or psychological necessity – to play shows as soon as possible.”</p> <p>At a grassroots level, the problems of reopening are even more complex. Nick Stewart, of small yet influential Edinburgh club Sneaky Pete’s, says that non-professional musicians with day jobs have “even more to negotiate. It just might not be possible for them to reschedule a tour for the third, fourth, fifth time.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/30/music-venues-british-culture-taskforce\">Music venues are where British culture is born. It's Britain's duty to keep them alive | Tony Naylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is precisely the case for Sarra Wild, a DIY promoter and DJ in Glasgow. “The first half of the pandemic was just: how am I going to pay rent? I can’t afford to put on an event and move it or cancel it, not even once.” Her itinerant club night OH141 hosts marginalised, innovative artists, and is designed to be as accessible as possible: “The most I would ever charge on the door is £12. It’s never been a venture to make money.” At Sneaky Pete’s, busy club nights help pay for gigs, which often run at a loss. As Stewart explains, the whole point at this level is to lead in “talent development” – Lewis Capaldi played his first gigs there.</p> <p>Several factors are essential to getting musicians back on stage in line with the roadmap. The UK’s live music industry, valued by UK Music at £1.1bn in 2018, needs a “comprehensive government-backed insurance and indemnity scheme”, says ASM Global’s Harrison. This would help thousands of freelancers return to the industry and reassure promoters, venues and musicians alike. “A band like us looks at an upfront investment of £25,000 to £50,000 in terms of deposits, equipment, booking rehearsals, hiring crew,” says Willgoose. “If you’re not insured, that’s not a good proposition.”</p> <p>In Scotland, the <a href=\"https://www.creativescotland.com/funding/funding-programmes/grassroots-music-venues-stabilisation-fund\">Grassroots Music Venues Stabilisation Fund</a> has prevented venues from going out of business because of continued overheads, but there are calls for essential support like this and the furlough scheme to continue long after venues can, technically, open. As Rou Reynolds summarises: “I’ll be able to deal with [more cancellations]. The industry and so many of its employees on the other hand, I’m not so sure.”</p>"

Brehmer said the married nurse sustained the fatal injury accidentally while he was trying to push her out of the car so he could drive away.</p> <p>Mr Justice Jacobs sentenced Brehmer to 10 and a half years for manslaughter. After a referral by the attorney general’s office under the unduly lenient sentence scheme, on Friday the court of appeal increased his sentence to 13 and half years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0baa50f0249815a5272c3c879a134c9c8bf43539\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0baa50f0249815a5272c3c879a134c9c8bf43539/0_228_2348_2348/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Timothy Brehmer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Timothy Brehmer was referred to the court of appeal under the unduly lenient sentence scheme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dorset police/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lord chief justice, Lord Burnett, said: “We have considered carefully the circumstances in which Claire Parry lost her life at the hands of this offender. With respect to the [sentencing] judge, we are satisfied that he gave too little weight to the aggravating factors he had identified.</p> <p>“The extent of her injuries shows that she was under attack for some time and clearly a period which exceeded the 10 to 30 seconds or more that her neck was compressed. She struggled in a fruitless attempt to protect herself and must have been aware of what was going to happen.</p> <p>“The offender’s conduct and lies after the attack were reprehensible and calculated to deflect attention from what he had done. These aggravating factors have the effect of moving above the starting point [for deciding the sentence] significantly before considering the mitigating factors.”</p> <p>The court of appeal also found that Jacobs had given Brehmer too large a discount for his guilty plea to the charge of manslaughter. Burnett ruled that the plea did not “reduce the impact of the crime upon victims” or save witnesses from having to testify. He added: “We doubt that the effect of the offender’s plea … afforded the family of Claire Parry much solace or comfort.”</p> <p>The attorney general, Michael Ellis QC, said: “Because of [Brehmers’] actions, Claire Parry’s family have lost a wife and mother and her community have lost a dedicated nurse. I greatly welcome the decision by the court of appeal today to increase Brehmer’s sentence.”</p>"

          "body": "<p>When the first Covid-19 vaccines were approved in the UK and elsewhere three months ago, many thought the end of the pandemic was almost within reach.</p> \n<p>Few, however, had anticipated the vast logistical problems involved in mass-producing and delivering billions of doses globally. This has been underlined by the high-profile political squabbles between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/18/eu-send-formal-letter-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-dispute\">UK and EU</a> over who should get which deliveries of vaccines from which factories amid shortages of doses.</p> \n<p>After the UK announced an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/18/matt-hancock-tells-mps-retest-on-covid-doses-and-delays-in-india-will-hit-uk-jabs\">imminent squeeze</a> on its own vaccine supply, we look at what is behind the holdups.</p> \n<h2><strong>Mass-producing the new vaccines is complicated</strong></h2> \n<p>There have been two broad approaches to large-scale production of Covid vaccines. The Oxford/AstraZeneca jab relies on a largely well-tested approach in which lab-produced cell cultures are produced in large bioreactors – a bit like brewing, but for vaccines.</p> \n<p>The second, newer technique, producing mRNA vaccines such as the Pfizer and Moderna jabs, involves a modified spike protein being cultured in the lab and then combined with enzymes and nucleotides before being packaged into tiny, fatty bubbles.</p> \n<p>Each technique has its own issues when it comes to scaling up mass production.</p> \n<h2><strong>What are the issues with </strong><strong>Oxford-style vaccines?</strong></h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/06/from-pfizer-to-moderna-whos-making-billions-from-covid-vaccines\">From Pfizer to Moderna: who's making billions from Covid-19 vaccines?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Typically a production facility for a vaccine like Oxford’s can take six to nine months to get going, although in this case it has been faster. The biggest issue is with so-called yields, which depend on the health of the underlying cell culture. Any quality control issues – for instance relating to temperature, humidity or compromised sterility – can lead to less vaccine at the end of the process, an issue that has been seen at some AstraZeneca production facilities around the world.</p> \n<p>While you might expect more or less identical production facilities to produce the same amount of vaccine, in fact yields can vary wildly, by as much as an order of three, especially in a new production process, which experts say is as much an “art as a science”. </p> \n<h2><strong>And with Pfizer-style vaccines?</strong></h2> \n<p>While mRNA vaccines are in some ways more straightforward to produce and much less vaccine is needed to produce a strong antibody response, the newness of the technology means key ingredients – such as the fatty bubbles and the nucleotides required for the “vaccine soup” – have been in short supply.</p> \n<p>And while vaccine manufacturers of both kinds have attempted to scale up quickly, there has also been a shortage of manufacturing facilities for sites that need to be built to the highest biosecurity standards.</p> \n<p>One issue is that some manufacturers that supply key elements needed for such vaccines have waited for the new jabs to advance in their development before taking the risk of committing to scaling up their own production.</p> \n<p>One recently reported example is the giant disposable plastic bags used as sterile liners inside bioreactor tanks for the Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax vaccines, which have emerged as a bottleneck in production in the EU and elsewhere.</p> \n<p>The bags are produced by a small number of suppliers, and vaccine producers have been struggling to source them, leading Merck recently to announce it would expand its facilities to eliminate this chokepoint.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2021/01/interactive-covid-world-map-tracker/vaccines\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Shouldn’t someone have anticipated all this?</strong></h2> \n<p>Some people did, including Bill Gates who wrote as long ago as last April that the scale of the pandemic meant that facilities needed to be built on spec. But while organisations such as Gavi, the global vaccine alliance, and some governments did invest in vaccine research and production facilities, there has been noticeable shortfalls in global preparedness that have created bottlenecks and led to a scramble for vaccines in short supply.</p> \n<p>More widely, some experts say the pharmaceuticals industry, while huge, is not structured for the kind of integrated global effort required to produce billions of doses of vaccine at short notice, including manufacturing of items for the fill and finish, such as glass vials, many of which are sourced from a handful of countries including India and China.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is there a pattern here?</strong></h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/18/covid-vaccine-side-effects-what-are-they-who-gets-them-and-why\">Covid vaccine side-effects: what are they, who gets them and why? | Nicola Davis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Liz Breen, an academic at the University of Bradford who studies health operations including supply chains, thinks so. “The effort to create new vaccines has been amazing, but along the way it’s as if some of the fundamentals have fallen by the wayside – the bread and butter stuff that makes scaling up possible,” she said. “I really do think people were so focused on the vaccines, they didn’t think further about what needs to come with it to make happen.”</p> \n<h2><strong>What about vaccine nationalism?</strong></h2> \n<p>With so many countries chasing insufficient doses, vaccine nationalism has become a real issue with threats of export restrictions of finished vaccines and raw materials. The UK has now been wrongfooted by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/18/uk-covid-vaccine-supply-hit-as-rise-in-indian-cases-diverts-doses-closer-to-home\">temporary shortfall</a> in deliveries of the Oxford vaccine from the Serum Institute of India, which has been contracted to produce it. With most vaccines requiring two doses delivered within a finite period, this has a knock-on effect for vaccination programmes.</p>"
