What better way to shake off that sluggish post-belly buster feeling than with a hearty tonic of Premier League action, with all of the big guns are in action. By big guns, we mean title contenders and by title contenders we are talking Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham. Then there is the Ole Gunnar Solskjær factor, in play at Old Trafford for the first time since 13 May 2007, the Norwegian’s last game for Manchester United (a 1-0 defeat to West Ham). And on a day on which many spend time with their elders, there is a 141-year-old battle taking place at Selhurst Park – sort of – as Roy Hodgson takes on Neil Warnock, who is eight months younger than his opposite number. As well as top-flight action, we will keep an eye on events across the country, with a whopping lineup of fixtures across the Championship, and beyond. </p> <h2>Premier League fixtures</h2> <p>Fulham L-L Wolves (12.30)<br>Burnley v Everton<br>Crystal Palace v Cardiff<br>Leicester v Man City<br>Liverpool v Newcastle<br>Man Utd v Huddersfield<br>Tottenham v Bournemouth<br>Brighton v Arsenal (5.15)<br>Watford v Chelsea (7.30)</p> <p><em>*all kick-offs 3pm (GMT) unless specified </em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-12-26T14:12:22.456Z\">at 2.12pm GMT</time></p>  </div>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfbca76980bc670f447b6bff8135408bdec664a8/224_37_2638_1583/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/dec/26/king-george-vi-chase-boxing-day-racing","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-26T15:19:34Z","webTitle":"Clan Des Obeaux wins King George VI Chase and Boxing Day racing – live!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/dec/26/king-george-vi-chase-boxing-day-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/dec/26/king-george-vi-chase-boxing-day-racing","fields":{"headline":"Clan Des Obeaux wins King George VI Chase and Boxing Day racing – live!","body":"<div id=\"block-5c239a37e4b072dc52e63daa\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-26T15:19:34.722Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">King George VI Chase (3.05) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1 <strong>Clan Des Obeau</strong>x (H Cobden) <strong>12-1 </strong><br>2 <strong>Thistlecrack</strong> (T Scudamore) <strong>15-2</strong> <br>3 <strong>Native River</strong> (R Johnson) <strong>9-2 </strong><br>10 ran</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2396cfe4b02fb91ff098e0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-26T15:05:26.825Z\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">King George VI Chase (3.05)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And they’re off ...

Both horses are trained by Nicky Henderson, and they had it between them from the second-last, where it looked like 1-4 favourite Buveur D’Air was always just going to do enough to hold on.</p> <p>He had made a terrible blunder at the third-last, hardly taking off, although it barely checked his momentum and Barry Geraghty seemingly had everything under control as he took up the running from Global Citizen. However, Nico de Boinville had yet to ask the mare Verdana Blue (11-2) for everything and she was gaining with every stride after the last. </p> <p>Buveur D’Air had not been beaten over hurdles since the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle in 2016, and while he continued to respond for Geraghty, Verdana Blue had too much speed for him this time, providing Henderson with an eighth win in the race. </p> <p>Henderson said: “It is a little bit (strange feeling). You don’t want him beaten. Barry is very good. You say you are sorry and I mean that, I will say that to JP (McManus), too. But I know he will say all is fair in love and war.</p> <p>“Thank goodness it was one of our own. Barry didn’t think it made a whole lot of difference (mistake at third-last). It didn’t stop him. He galloped merrily on. It is the second time he has gone through a hurdle. He said ‘no excuses’. </p> <p>“She is a very good mare and she always has been when you get her on decent ground, as she is no good on soft ground. Unless you can promise it will be good to firm it will be a waste of time (training for Champion Hurdle). The plan was to go for the 200,000 stayers’ race (on the Flat) at Lingfield on Good Friday, as my jockey that day (when winning on the Flat at Kempton), Luke Morris, said that is what she will win.” <br></p> <p>He added: “Buveur will go to either Sandown (Contenders Hurdle) or Wincanton (Kingwell) as they are the only two you have got. Barry is not worried as he said he has won his race. Round here on that ground she is very good.” <strong>PA</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-12-26T15:13:23.251Z\">at 3.13pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c2394c0e4b0cebe7617b5ab\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-26T14:49:39.652Z\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">King George VI Chase (3.05) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As any schoolboy ought to know, Cheltenham and Kempton are very different tracks and horses which prosper at Prestbury are by no means certain to succeed in Sunbury. Still, it is odd indeed to see the reigning Gold Cup winner, <strong>Native River (3.05)</strong>, being so cold-shouldered in the betting for this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/king-george-vi-chase\">King George VI Chase</a>.</p> <p>At the time of writing he is only sixth in the list with some firms, bigger in places than his stablemate Thistlecrack, who has not won for two years. He may not be the fastest or the flashiest in a fascinating field but Native River may very well be the toughest of them and represents excellent value at 6-1 or bigger.</p> <p>Some are put off by the memory of his third place behind Tea For Two in the novice chase on this card three years ago, when he jumped left at some fences and ran way below the level that will be required here. This will be his first time round a right-handed circuit since then.</p> <p>But he was only a novice and ran to a similar level that day as in his other races around then. Two things made Native River the horse we now know and both came at the end of that season: the switch to more aggressive, pace-pushing tactics and the employment of Richard Johnson as his jockey. Had both been in place when he ran at Kempton in 2015, he might have fared better. There is no shame in being bested by Bristol De Mai around Haydock, as Native River was last month. He will be fitter now and the grey, of course, is playing away from his favourite venue.</p> <p>Excuses are available for Might Bite’s Haydock flop and a much improved performance is expected here. Still, his odds are hardly generous in the circumstances and the memory persists of his being outbattled by Native River at Cheltenham. His chance rests on having too much pace for his rival on this drier surface.</p> <p>It looks like a King George in which stamina will be tested, which could be a problem for Politologue and Waiting Patiently. Thistlecrack was running on at the end of the Betfair and has a chance to get involved if that has brought him on.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c239252e4b072dc52e63d76\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-26T14:41:39.968Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Buveur D’Air made a bad mistake three out, going right through the hurdle.

Having met with defeat went sent off favourite on his hurdling debut at Newbury last month, the Nicky Henderson-trained four year-old made up for that reversal in the two-mile prize.</p> <p>Ridden close to the pace, the 7-2 shot took command of matters between the final two flights before defeating early pace-setter Rouge Vif by two and three-quarter lengths. Henderson said: “He ran a good race at Newbury (when second on debut), but we just thought we would ride him more aggressively. He has enjoyed his work up front, so we let him do his own thing. They were trapping most of the way, too. He jumped very well and quickened up well.” </p> <p>Paddy Power cut the winner to 14-1 from the 33-1 for the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle at Cheltenham in March, and Henderson said: “You would have to think so (Supreme class). I’ve been lucky, with Angels Breath and a few others lurking in there.” Looking to more immediate plans, the Seven Barrows trainer said: “There is the Dovecote (at Kempton). I don’t think we will go to Musselburgh, as we got a lot of bloody noses up there last season.” <strong>PA</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a162641e0174122cfcb13f053f6cc699102a3f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a162641e0174122cfcb13f053f6cc699102a3f8/0_7_2460_1476/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mister Fisher lands the first at Kempton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mister Fisher lands the first at Kempton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Cargill/racingfotos.com/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-12-26T13:49:04.853Z\">at 1.49pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c2384fbe4b0cebe7617b543\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-26T13:42:00.811Z\">1.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Kauto Star Novice Chase (1.55) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Nicky Henderson fields Santini here and victory for the hugely promising sort would surprise nobody.

Might Bite has been friendless over Christmas, however, drifting out to 4-1 this morning, while everyone has been eager to get with Waiting Patiently, who is attempting to defy a couple of very dauting statistics this afternoon. No horse has won the King George on its seasonal debut, while Desert Orchid, in 1986, was the last to win on its first start at three miles.<br></p> <p>Politologue is also attempting to defy the latter trend, but has been the pick of quite a few tipsters this morning and is also very solid in the market as a result. As things stand, the King George now has joint-favourites at the best prices available, with Might Bite and Waiting Patiently both on 4-1, while Politologue is 6-1 in a place but more generally an 11-2 or 5-1 chance. Native River, the Gold Cup winner, is 6-1 with Bristol De Mai and Thistlecrack, the brilliant winner in his novice season two years ago, at 8-1 and 9-1 respectively.<br></p> <p> So that means there are six horses in a 10-runner field at a single-figure price and it is very difficult to think of a King George over the last 30 years that offered so many possibilities. With Buveur D’Air, the Champion Hurdle winner, also in attendance for what is likely to be a stroll to victory in the Christmas Hurdle and Santini, the RSA Chase favourite, lining up for the Kauto Star Novice Chase, it is an outstanding King George card even by Kempton’s normal standards and the action will get underway in just under an hour.</p> </div>   </div>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/e70da9c90f9228623edf672b1ec28a438d7c6944/14_0_4510_2706/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/dec/26/war-detectives-get-new-lead-on-british-dead-from-korean-war-thanks-to-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-26T15:05:54Z","webTitle":"'War detectives' get new lead on British dead from Korean war, thanks to Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/26/war-detectives-get-new-lead-on-british-dead-from-korean-war-thanks-to-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/dec/26/war-detectives-get-new-lead-on-british-dead-from-korean-war-thanks-to-trump","fields":{"headline":"'War detectives' get new lead on British dead from Korean war, thanks to Trump","body":"<p>It has been described as the forgotten war. One hundred thousand British soldiers fought in the Korean conflict between 1950 and 1953, but its hold on the memory of the nation is weak, a painful reality for the relatives of the 336 Britons still listed as missing in action and for whom there is no known grave.</p> <p>But in an office located at Gloucestershire’s Imjin army barracks, named after the battle of Imjin River at which 650 soldiers of the Gloucestershire regiment faced 10,000 Chinese soldiers, the Ministry of Defence’s “war detectives” believe they may now be able to help keep some memories alive, thanks, in part, to Donald Trump.</p> <p>When the US president met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, the North Korean dictator had pledged as a sign of goodwill to hand over remains of the allied dead from the Korean war, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/02/donald-trump-north-korea-us-war-remains-tweet\">an act that duly took place</a> later in the summer.</p> <p>Caskets holding some 55 to 60 skeletons were given to the Americans, who are seeking to extract DNA from the remains in an attempt to link them to the missing.</p> <p>The British suffered the second-largest losses of the countries that took part in the war, an early cold war conflict. Researchers in the British Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (JCCC), who work on retrieving and identifying the British war dead, believe there is a chance that some of those remains will be theirs.</p> <p>The task set for Nicola Nash, an archaeologist in the JCCC, known within the British army as the war detectives, is to trace the relatives of the British missing and secure a DNA sample to cross-check with the Americans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9eded58c22ebc000cf1a8e2898192a2658cf9d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9eded58c22ebc000cf1a8e2898192a2658cf9d4/0_155_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Nash (left) at a burial ceremony for an unknown British first world war soldier near Ypres in Belgium\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Nash (left) at a burial ceremony for an unknown British first world war soldier near Ypres in Belgium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The Americans are extracting DNA samples from the sets of remains that they were given and now all the nations that lost men during the Korean war are doing their best to get DNA samples from family members of men who died,” Nash said. “I have put together a definitive list of men with no known graves in the British armed forces during the war. There are around 300 but around 50 of those were lost at sea or buried at sea, so we have discounted those. All these remains have been found on land. So that leaves me with 255 families that I am trying to trace.”</p> <p>The JCCC is trying to build family trees of the missing in order to get in contact with relatives. Of the 250 soldiers, the relatives of around 30 are in contact with them, with work on tracking the rest continuing.</p> <p>“But all it takes is one family to read this and think, Oh, yeah, and make contact and that saves hours of work,” said Nash. “So once they get in contact with me I have a database to keep the information together. I have got DNA tests waiting to go out to families. Simple mouth swabs, all very easy, and we send that to them with a stamped addressed envelope, and they send it back to us and it goes over to the American lab.”</p> <p>The work is familiar to Nash. Six months before Kim Jong-un handed over the remains found in North Korea, two skeletons were given to the British by the South Koreans.</p> <p>Found by the Imjin River, both sides agreed that they were likely to be members of the “Glorious Glocs”, the Gloucestershire regiment that fought in the battle there in April 1951, from which only 40 of the 650 British soldiers survived.</p> <p>Nash has DNA samples from those two sets of remains, and 20 DNA sets have been sent to the relatives of the Gloucestershire regiment soldiers who have no known grave, out of a total missing in action of between 35 and 40.</p> <p>“Most of the relatives we have been in contact with are really close, you know, children, siblings,” said Nash. “So it is quite emotional for the families to have us get in contact after all these years.</p> <p>“It is a small chance, but it is a chance that their relatives could be found,” she added. “I spoke to one chap who is the son of someone who died in the Gloucestershire regiment and it was really emotional for him. He had spent his whole life not knowing what happened to his father.</p> <p>“The most important thing we want people to take away from this is if they have a relative with no known grave from the Korean war to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/joint-casualty-and-compassionate-centre-jccc#contact-us\">get in contact with us,</a>” Nash said. “The Americans lost by far the most but the next largest was the British, so there is every chance we will come across a positive match and, at that point, they would get the full military burial with honours at the UN cemetery in Busan.”</p>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee4f3493ca5f986af719203f739bf941d8ae5685/0_24_1926_1155/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/dec/26/sylvia-pankhurst-politics-suffragette","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-26T14:59:27Z","webTitle":"Sylvia Pankhurst’s popularity shows the shifting nature of politics | Martin Kettle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/26/sylvia-pankhurst-politics-suffragette","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/26/sylvia-pankhurst-politics-suffragette","fields":{"headline":"Sylvia Pankhurst’s popularity shows the shifting nature of politics","body":"<p>Newspapers are about the present not the past. It’s rare for a long-dead historical figure to make it into them, let alone twice in just a few days. That’s the sort of feat that only someone with instant name recognition like Winston Churchill would normally achieve. So when, just before Christmas, there were two separate news stories about Sylvia Pankhurst, it got me thinking about how we make use of our history nowadays and what it says about us.</p> <p>The first Pankhurst story revealed that the former suffragette had written to the postmaster general in 1934 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/18/sylvia-pankhurst-letters-reveal-concerns-phone-tapping-surveillance\" title=\"\">complain about government phone-tapping</a>. There was no firm suggestion that Pankhurst’s own phone might have been tapped. But her eye had been caught by a contemporary news report about post office eavesdropping, and she wrote to protest at an activity she felt was “opposed to the very best interests of the community and contrary to public policy”.</p> <p>Then there was a second, very different Pankhurst story. This one, also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/dec/20/sylvia-pankhurst-paintings-of-women-at-work-acquired-for-tate\" title=\"\">quite widely reported</a>, was that Tate had acquired four of her watercolours of working women with funds from the betting magnate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/24/meet-denise-coates-best-paid-bet-365\" title=\"\">Denise Coates</a>. The young Pankhurst had trained in Manchester and at the Royal College of Art. In 1907 she did a series of pictures of women in the pottery and cotton industries. The experience deepened the socialist beliefs that dominated her long and extraordinary life.</p> <p>And her life was truly extraordinary, as I discovered when I visited Addis Ababa nearly half a century ago. A friend took me for a ride in his car to show me some of the sights of the Ethiopian capital. To my astonishment, Sylvia Pankhurst Street (it is still there today). It appeared to run right through Addis Ababa’s red light district. I took a photo and we got back in the car. “Any idea how it got its name?” asked my friend. I replied that I had no idea. So he told me.</p> <p>Back in 1969, Sylvia Pankhurst was more celebrated in Ethiopia than in Britain. She was generally remembered in Britain, insofar as she was remembered at all, largely as “a Pankhurst”. In the pantheon of influence within Britain’s premiere militant suffragette family, she stood below her mother Emmeline and sister Christabel, but above her younger sister Adela.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps we shouldn’t focus so much on knocking statues down or building new ones</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the leftwing world in which I grew up, we knew something more. We knew that Sylvia became a communist, and met Lenin in Moscow, and that she was later denounced by the Soviet leader for refusing to support parliamentarism in Britain and joining the newly formed Communist party in 1920. The elderly communists I talked to about her half a century ago all seemed to agree with Bernard Shaw’s comparison of her with his own Saint Joan: often magnificent yet sometimes impossible.</p> <p>Of the final 35 years of Pankhurst’s life, however, most British people on the left were probably as ignorant as I was. Many still are. It can still surprise them to hear that this feminist and socialist with the famous name devoted the second half of her life to the causes of Italian anti-fascism and then, overwhelmingly, to Abyssinia (later Ethiopia) after Italy invaded in 1935. So consuming was this commitment that she eventually moved from Essex to Addis Ababa after the war, and died there in 1960. Emperor Haile Selassie, a lifelong friend, ensured she had a state funeral, and was buried in the grounds of the city’s Ethiopian Orthodox cathedral. Presumably he ordered the street name too.</p> <p>Pankhurst was therefore by any standards an incredibly interesting and unusual person. I’ve studied her ever since that trip to Addis Ababa long ago. The different focuses of her life – Mancunian radicalism, women’s suffrage militancy, anti-war activism, communism, anti-fascism and solidarity with Africa, to say nothing of her writings, poems, paintings and her determined opposition to marriage – all add up to an exceptional story.</p> <p>Here’s the reason her life says something about us and our use of history. Pankhurst was a remarkable person, who had some very modern ideas that make her highly sympathetic through 21st-century progressive eyes. As a result she was unquestionably also extremely important.</p> <p>Pankhurst is far more revered and studied today than in her lifetime. Biographies, of which I struggled to find any in 1969, proliferate. Her writings, hard to find in the past, are again in print. Her life <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/18/sylvia-review-old-vic-suffragette-musical-pankhurst\" title=\"\">was celebrated</a> in a musical at London’s Old Vic theatre in the autumn. There is an <a href=\"http://sylviapankhurst.gn.apc.org/\" title=\"\">ongoing campaign</a> to get a statue of her erected in the capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3075585869bb90cf569a4388fc10348b872f59ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3075585869bb90cf569a4388fc10348b872f59ce/0_27_2333_1399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher memorial\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The statue of Margaret Thatcher, rejected by Westminster and now erected in her home town Grantham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Douglas Jennings/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But historically? In her own time? I think it would be hard not to conclude that the historically more important Pankhurst sister – in her own lifetime – was Christabel. If we accept the argument that it was the militant suffragettes, led by the Pankhursts, who won the vote for some women in 1918, then it was Christabel who shaped this outcome more than Sylvia.</p> <p>Unlike Sylvia, however, Christabel does not strike a chord with 21st-century progressives. She was enthusiastically pro-war in 1914, where Sylvia was against. She moved right not left. She joined the Conservatives. She became an evangelical Christian. She became a Dame, while Sylvia went without honours. (Adela Pankhurst’s fall from grace was even worse – she became a fascist and was interned in Australia in 1942 for being pro-Japanese.)</p> <p>There is a larger issue about history here. Today’s honouring of Sylvia Pankhurst is overdue. Her story, like that of women in general, and remarkable women such as her in particular, was hidden from history for generations by male historians. The collective story must clearly be expanded to include the Sylvias. But we must not write the Christabels out of it because they are less to our contemporary taste. History is not about one or the other. It’s about both.</p> <p>Our nation – and we aren’t alone in this – is conflicted in its approach to history. Too often, as the Economist’s Bagehot column <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/11/08/peterloo-v-waterloo-the-historical-divide-in-british-politics\" title=\"\">put it recently</a>, our politics is “wedded to sharply contrasting interpretations of British history, which focus on very different events and freight them with very different emotions”. The wish to memorialise Sylvia Pankhurst is as much an illustration of this tendency to polarise on the left as the Tory right’s wish to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-46289702\" title=\"\">memorialise Margaret Thatcher</a>.</p> <p>So, perhaps we shouldn’t focus so much on knocking statues down or building new ones. Perhaps our understanding of history, and of the way humans think, act and speak, should be more capacious, more inquiring and more generous than this – more sprawling, less political, more acknowledging of differences, messiness and of things we think we would never do now. History will always be a dialogue between the present and the past. But it should be a humble dialogue, because none of us knows everything.</p> <p>• Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/6169a3795d7d10200f2b1285d467966e5fe68076/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/dec/26/flashpoints-2018-sport-serena-williams-us-open-final-flushing-meadows","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-26T14:43:51Z","webTitle":"Flashpoints of 2018: Serena Williams blows her top in the US Open final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/dec/26/flashpoints-2018-sport-serena-williams-us-open-final-flushing-meadows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/dec/26/flashpoints-2018-sport-serena-williams-us-open-final-flushing-meadows","fields":{"headline":"Flashpoints of 2018: Serena Williams blows her top in the US Open final","body":"<p>The turmoil that enveloped Serena Williams and Carlos Ramos during the final of the 2018 US Open had little or nothing to do with racism or sexism as it was widely portrayed at the time and is lingeringly perceived.</p> <p>However, from the player’s perspective it did have distant roots in prejudice and struggle, which exist beyond tennis. Also, it was made possible by an uneven battle of wills, the lauded and entitled champion bumping up against the inconvenience of authority, which is part of the culture of modern sport.</p> <p>When Williams began to lose control of the match and her composure she trained her frustrations not on her dignified opponent, Naomi Osaka, but on the one person who could not fight back in kind. Williams wanted an argument; Ramos, the chair umpire who swung no racket, wanted peace and order – so he reacted with the only weapon at his disposal, the laws of tennis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/06/serena-williams-meltdown-us-open-final-mcenroe-naomi-osaka\">Serena Williams’s US meltdown was handled badly all round, says McEnroe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ramos, the only person to have umpired singles finals in all four majors, is widely regarded as firm but fair, irrespective of a player’s gender, race or reputation. He brought all that experience to bear in imposing three code violations, which resulted in Williams forfeiting a whole game in the second set and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/08/serena-williams-rails-at-umpire-as-superb-naomi-osaka-wins-us-open\" title=\"\">throwing away a grand slam final she should have won</a>. Victory would have moved her alongside Margaret Court on 24 majors, more than any other player, male or female, had ever won. To do so in front of her home crowd, at 37, a year and a week after giving birth to her first child, would have been the crowning achievement of her career. Her disappointment in losing to a player making her debut in a grand slam final was immense.</p> <p>From a distance there was an obvious inclination to side with Williams, several columnists and commentators arguing that this would never happen to a man of similar standing in the game, while heaping opprobrium on Ramos, the Portuguese martinet<em> du jour</em>. Close up it was more nuanced.</p> <p>Williams, down a set and up 1-0 and 15-40 in the second, was stunned when Ramos warned her for a coaching violation from the stands by Patrick Mouratoglou [which he admitted in a post-match TV interview]. She told the umpire, “If he’s giving me a thumbs-up, he’s telling me to come on. We don’t have any code, and I know you don’t know that, and I understand why you thought that was coaching but I’m telling you it’s not. I don’t cheat to win. I’d rather lose.”</p> <p>The matter seemed done. But Williams, still agitated, sought assurance on the next changeover that Ramos understood what she had said. He replied, pointedly, “I understood your reaction [to Mouratoglou] as well.” This unsettled her further.</p> <p>She broke Osaka to lead 3-1 but then double-faulted twice in a row from 30-15. On break point she dumped a backhand and turned to her box, shouting “I can’t get over the top of the ball”, before smashing her racket into the court. Ramos issued her with a second code violation and docked her a point. He had done no more than follow protocol. “This is unbelievable!” she screamed at Ramos, who remained calm. “Every time I play here I have problems.” It was true.</p> <p>Aggrieved at calls against her and delivering high-grade invective at the officials, Williams also erupted when losing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/sep/09/tennis.usopentennis2004\" title=\"\">2004 quarter-final against Jennifer Capriati</a>, the 2009 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/13/serena-williams-tirade-us-open\" title=\"\">semi-final against Kim Clijsters</a>, and the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/12/samantha-stosur-wins-us-open\" title=\"\"> 2011 final against Sam Stosur</a>. Her past crowded in on her again in 2018. Incandescent, she told Ramos, “You owe me an apology, I have never cheated in my life. I have a daughter and I stand for what is right for her.” It was an incongruous point to make.</p> <p>Osaka held and broke, to lead 4-3. She was two games from becoming the first able-bodied Japanese player, man or woman, to win a major and, at 20, the youngest at Flushing Meadows since Maria Sharapova in 2006.</p> <p>Williams’s tirade continued on the changeover: “You will never, ever, ever be on another court of mine as long as you live!” She called Ramos, “a liar” and, “a cheat”. Pausing to absorb the insult, he waited until she had almost returned to her position at the baseline to receive serve, then shocked the packed Arthur Ashe Stadium by awarding the game to Osaka without a ball struck.</p> <p>Williams, needing to hold to stay in the match, halted play and pleaded for understanding from the tournament referee, Brian Earley, and the WTA supervisor, Donna Kelso. “There are men out here who do a lot worse than me,” she said, “but, because I’m a woman, you are going to take this away from me? That is not right.”</p> <p>For her supporters that was Williams’s golden bullet of defence. She was being picked on because she was a woman. But Kelso could do nothing for her. Nor could Earley. History was not much help either. The New York Times later listed the men and women who had incurred code violations in the four majors in the 20 years to 2018. In the categories for which she was punished 646 men were fined for racket abuse, 99 women; for coaching, though, it was 87 men, 152 women.</p> <p>Williams held to love, eyes blazing, and threatened a fightback. But she could not stop Osaka closing out the match to win 6-2, 6-4 in an hour and 19 minutes that none of us present will easily forget. To witness the volcanic explosion first-hand was to feel and hear the wail of resentment, a sense of injustice that had gathered in her soul over years and was distilled into an almost blind rage.</p> <p>What happened that afternoon began not when Ramos spotted Mouratoglou gesturing to Williams to come to the net but on the streets of Compton in south Los Angeles, where Richard Williams took his family away from the relative calm of Saginaw, Michigan – where Serena was born in 1981, a year after Venus – to give his children an appreciation of struggle in a tough environment.</p> <p>For Serena and Venus it was a brief education and they left Compton in 1990 for the warmth, comfort and coaching facilities of Florida, where their tennis journey continued. One of their three half-sisters, Yetunde, stayed, however, and was murdered in a drive-by shooting in Compton in 2003. The family were devastated.</p> <p>Late in the 2018 season Serena was reminded of the tragedy shortly before going on court to play Johanna Konta in the first round of the Silicon Valley Classic. She learned that Yetunde’s killer had been released from jail. “I couldn’t shake it out of my mind,” she said. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/16/serena-williams-jo-konta-yetunde-price\" title=\"\">She won just one game in the heaviest defeat of her career</a>. Her path to New York was thus a troubled one. Although she had played well in her comeback season – reaching the fourth round at Roland Garros and losing to Angelique Kerber in the Wimbledon final – Williams revealed shortly before the US Open she had been coping with post-natal depression.</p> <p>What is curious about the incident that September evening is that it sprang from an arcane and fiddling point of tennis legality. Williams could have ignored it. But she was a prisoner of her past.</p> <p>Another curiosity: while coaching is allowed outside the majors, nobody could recall ever previously seeing Williams look to her team for advice or support to take advantage of it. She always fixes her gaze across the net – except on the worst night of her career, when she chose to engage a determined umpire in a futile exchange that cost her a title she should, and could, have won.</p>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/07994cb9910c640e96fa09541d9b6106d1508207/91_189_2494_1497/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/dec/26/fulham-wolves-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-26T14:39:46Z","webTitle":"Fulham 1-1 Wolves: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/dec/26/fulham-wolves-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/dec/26/fulham-wolves-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Fulham 1-1 Wolves: Premier League – as it happened","body":"<div id=\"block-5c239281e4b0cebe7617b5a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-26T14:39:46.489Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>That’s all from me</strong>, thanks for joining me and for your emails and tweets.

Not exactly. <strong>2/10</strong></p> \n   <p><strong>Stars/flops </strong>It’s fair to say that the latter have outweighed the former. Our summer spree left us with a group of individuals, not a team. Calum Chambers has blossomed in his new defensive midfield role, Ryan Sessegnon continues to impress, Tom Cairney has his moments and Big Mitro will score if given service. At the other end, Sergio Rico has done well behind a porous back line – but otherwise the list of flops is, alas, a lengthy one. A couple of decent results could still change things, though.</p> \n   <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>It’ll have to be a <strong>6/10</strong> for now, while we see how things develop. We remain extremely grateful to Slavisa Jokanovic for steering us to promotion, and very upset that he was sacked – but something probably did have to give. Only time will tell if Claudio Ranieri can get us out of this mess.</p> \n   <p><strong>Moment of 2018 </strong>Our play-off win at Wembley. The explosion of noise from the “white wall” at the end was extraordinary. That glorious feeling of total unity and solidarity doesn’t come around too often – and, as we’ve seen since, is all too easy to squander. Oh, and a personal moment for me – the publication of <a href=\"http://www.toofif.co.uk/toofif-book.html\">There’s Only One F In Fulham</a>, a book on our rollercoaster journey over the last 30 years!</p> \n   <p>• <strong>David Lloyd </strong><a href=\"http://toofif.co.uk/\">Toofif.co.uk</a></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>You can read the rest of the verdicts (Arsenal-Huddersfield) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/23/premier-league-fans-verdict-part-one-arsenal-huddersfield\">here</a>. </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <h2><strong>Wolves</strong></h2> \n   <p>It’s been mixed: a bright start followed by a run of one point from a possible 18. But Nuno didn’t panic, made some changes and oversaw some important, impressive wins to get back on track. <strong>7/10</strong></p> \n   <p><strong>Stars/flops </strong>Willy Boly has been outstanding, and people are also beginning to sit up and take notice of teenage academy product Morgan Gibbs-White. As for flops – apart from Raúl Jiménez, our forwards have struggled to make a consistent impact. Diogo Jota seems to be rediscovering his spark, though, after a pretty tough start.</p> \n   <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>He’s a wizard: the transformation of players such as Matt Doherty, Ryan Bennett and Conor Coady in the past 18 months has been astonishing. All three have more than looked the part at this level and that’s largely thanks to him. He also showed an ability to adapt the way we played following that poor run. <strong>8/10</strong></p> \n   <p><strong>Moment of 2018 </strong>The aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/06/cardiff-wolves-championship-match-report\">that Cardiff game in April</a>: Neil Warnock telling Nuno in no uncertain terms where to go after his side had missed two injury-time penalties, which essentially sealed the league title for us.

Enough of the in-laws, one-too-many questions about how the new job is going, I bet you can’t look at another mince pie. It’s probably a bit too brazen to just stick on Sky Sports in the middle of the living room where your sister is playing that new board game, but a quiet moment upstairs to check the MBM is probably allowed. Welcome. </p> \n  <p>Luckily, football is here to save us all on Boxing Day. It always is. And a lot like how our Australian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZAbbasOfficial/status/1077902134895656966\">and South African</a> counterparts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/26/australia-india-boxing-day-test-day-one--report\">feel about Test cricket</a>, a bit of sport is an excellent excuse to put all that Christmas stuff behind us. Now we can look forward to NYE and Fulham v Wolves. <br></p> \n  <p>It should be an excellent game. Last season, in the Championship, Fulham and Wolves each won one game each at home, the former depending on strikes from Ryan Sessegnon and Aleksandar Mitrovic to get a 2-0 win in February earlier this year. You suspect that if Fulham are to get a similar scoreline today – and avoid relegation this season – those two will play a major part. </p> \n  <p>Lose today, and Fulham will be exactly half-way through the season with 10 points, which means they will almost certainly still be bottom of the league. A draw today means that they will equal the worst ever Premier League points total for a season – 11, set by Derby County in 2007-08 – so at least that’s something. There’s something in me here which senses a win for Fulham today, though, and I’m not really sure why.</p> \n  <p>Wolves have had a fine season, all-in-all. Thirteen points clear of the relegation zone, they have won three of the last four, and there was no shame in last Friday’s defeat to Liverpool. A win here would lift them to seventh, a point off Manchester United. Not that that is a barometer of success anymore, but it sounds quite impressive, doesn’t it?</p> \n  <p><strong>Kick-off: 12.30pm GMT</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-12-26T12:25:31.239Z\">at 12.25pm GMT</time></p> \n</div>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/95e195565420c3970c6f7d530ce4b986f0d0b22f/0_80_3160_1897/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/dec/26/brother-of-mafia-supergrass-shot-dead-on-christmas-day","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-26T14:31:19Z","webTitle":"Brother of mafia supergrass shot dead on Christmas Day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/26/brother-of-mafia-supergrass-shot-dead-on-christmas-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/dec/26/brother-of-mafia-supergrass-shot-dead-on-christmas-day","fields":{"headline":"Brother of mafia supergrass shot dead on Christmas Day","body":"<p>The brother of a former mafia member who turned supergrass was fatally shot by two hooded men on Christmas Day , in what police suspect was a killing ordered by a clan of the powerful Calabrian mafia, the ‘Ndrangheta.</p> <p>Marcello Bruzzese, 51, was killed while he was returning home in the historical centre of Pesaro, in the Italian region of the Marche.</p> <p>According to the police, the killers, who were wearing balaclavas, waited near the victim’s apartment and fired at least 20 shots at him.</p> <p>Bruzzese’s father, Domenico, a lieutenant of the notorious boss Teodoro Crea, was killed in 1995 in what was thought to be a mafia ambush.

Though retail sales increased more than expected in November, from 1.4% the previous month, the picture for the high street remains bleak. For the three months to November, the sales growth was just 0.4% on the previous quarter.</p> <p>The Local Government Association, which represents councils, welcomed the funding but warned that the bidding process must be “kept proportionate” and called for flexibility in how the money can be spent.</p> <p>Cllr Martin Tett, the Local Government Association’s economy spokesman, said: “Many councils throughout the country are already leading the way in transforming the future potential of their town centres in the face of unprecedented changes in shopping habits and the retail landscape.</p> <p>“We are pleased that the government has acted by providing an injection of desperately needed funding into revitalising our town centres, but it is important that the bidding process is kept proportionate and that councils have full flexibility over how this funding is spent as each place will require different solutions to their unique circumstances.”</p> <p>High streets minister Jake Berry MP said: “We all know high streets are changing, we can’t hide from this reality. But we’re determined to ensure they continue to sit at the heart of our communities for generations to come.</p> <p>“To do this we have to support investment in infrastructure, boosting local economies and ensuring people are able to get the most out of their local high streets. Empowering leaders on the ground is key too – they best understand the challenges facing their areas.</p> <p>“Our future high streets fund will drive forward this change, transforming our town centres into the thriving community hubs of the future.”</p> <p>Chair of the Town Centres Expert Panel, Timpson added: “By helping our towns create their own individual community hub, I believe we will have vibrant town centres to provide a much-needed place for face to face contact in the digital age.”</p> <p>Up to £55m of the fund will be set aside to support the regeneration of what the government calls “heritage high streets”, restoring old properties to transform them into work spaces or culture venues.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 26 December 2018 to clarify in headline and text that the government fund is for councils in England.</p>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/1778b0bce7e25311d74e57f68aed2a934a37d93a/33_237_2869_1721/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/dec/26/boxing-day-sales-uk-shoppers-high-streets-retail","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-26T13:53:09Z","webTitle":"Boxing Day sales draw fewer UK shoppers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/26/boxing-day-sales-uk-shoppers-high-streets-retail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/dec/26/boxing-day-sales-uk-shoppers-high-streets-retail","fields":{"headline":"Boxing Day sales draw fewer UK shoppers","body":"<p>The number of shoppers visiting retailers on Boxing Day has fallen for the third year in a row as worries about the economy and the rise of internet shopping <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/26/councils-to-bid-for-share-of-675m-fund-to-invigorate-uk-high-streets\">takes its toll on high streets</a>.</p> <p>The average number of visitors to shopping centres, high streets and retail parks, had slid 4.2% year-on-year by midday Wednesday, according to data from analysts at Springboard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Diane Wehrle, the insights director at at Springboard, said: “Boxing Day has become less important as a trading day.

Hoa Hakananai’a, as it is known, meaning “lost or stolen friend”, is a looming and powerful presence. On its back it bears a carving of a winged figure, witness to the complex history of the object – over time the religion of the islanders changed, and they began to honour “birdmen” instead of the great carved ancestor figures.</p> <p>Later, Hoa Hakananai’a was collected, under circumstances that the British Museum website <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=512302&amp;partId=1\" title=\"\">does not make entirely plain</a>, by Richard Ashmore Powell, commander of the British navy frigate HMS Topaze. It was then given to Queen Victoria, from whom it came to the museum. This autumn, Tarita Alarcón Rapu, the governor of Rapa Nui, made a tearful request for the sculpture’s return. “We are just a body. You, the British people, have our soul,” she said. What was less publicised was the fact that the governor was there at the invitation of the British Museum and that meetings will continue in 2019 in Rapa Nui.</p> <p>Such stories appear regularly in the press, and always have done. Indeed, the history of imperial powers helping themselves by fair means or foul to precious artefacts goes back at least to the Roman empire. Greece’s temples were stripped of their ritual objects by their Roman conquerors. Transferred to the villas of the wealthy, these sculptures became aestheticised into something else: “art”, the status symbols of collectors.</p> <p><strong>Identity politics</strong></p> <p>Such news stories will arrive with ever more intensity in 2019 and the years to come. Calls to restitute cultural property, like calls to topple Rhodes, decolonise university curricula, or stop cultural appropriation, are part of a wider societal trend that can be placed under the heading of identity politics. And, like identity politics, demands for restitution are not going away. Both for ethical and pragmatic reasons, they must be taken seriously.</p> <p>The debate about cultural restitution has been stirred up in the past month by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/21/france-urged-to-return-looted-african-art-treasures-macron\" title=\"\">report</a> commissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, as the direct result of a speech he made last year in Ouagadougou declaring that the restitution of African heritage to Africa would be a “top priority”. The radical and forthright report, by the scholars Bénédicte Savoy and Felwine Sarr, has had a mixed response. Some have welcomed the authors’ conclusion that all objects collected under colonial conditions ought to be restored unless evidence can be provided that they were collected legitimately – reversing the burden of proof so that it is borne by the former colonial power rather than the former colonies. Many have applauded the clarity with which Professor Savoy and Professor Sarr have described the long-term effects of the appropriation of artefacts. The removal of cultural property not only affects the generation from whom it is taken, <a href=\"https://frieze.com/article/will-macron-lead-restitution-african-cultural-heritage\" title=\"\">they write</a>, “it becomes inscribed throughout the long duration of societies, conditioning the flourishing of certain societies while simultaneously continuing to weaken others”.</p> <p>The report has received a less hearty welcome among the museum directors of northern Europe, however. Some point out that it was commissioned not from a sense of responsibility by Mr Macron but as a means of furthering his nation’s interests in sub-Saharan Africa (the report, indeed, limits itself to that region, excluding former French colonies in north Africa and elsewhere). Others say that the blanket assertion that any and all acquisitions for museums made under colonial conditions are wrong is a gross simplification. Items entered museum collections for all kinds of reasons, they argue. These range from cases of obvious looting (as in the example of the Benin bronzes taken in the 1890s by European troops from the royal palace in Benin City) to items that were perfectly legitimately traded, or indeed freely given. They say that the report gives little or no attention to the real-world, on-the-ground cooperation between museum professionals in northern Europe and their colleagues in other parts of the world.</p> <p><strong>Imperial past</strong></p> <p>All of this is sensible. At worst, however, western museum professionals can convey the notion – even if it is not uttered out loud – that objects are somehow “better off” in Paris, London or Berlin than elsewhere, where they can, according to this unspoken assumption, be properly cared for and admired. It is unhelpful that major museum directors in this context remain almost invariably white men of similar background and education – an “all-male choir”, as one <a href=\"https://www.modernghana.com/news/903450/france-marches-to-restitution-of-looted-african-artefacts-w.html\" title=\"\">African commentator</a> has put it.</p> <p>Disputes over cultural property cannot be seen in isolation. They must be taken together with an understanding that the imperial past is not dead but is a set of narratives that are still alive, still unresolved, and still bringing real-world consequences. In the end, resolving ownership of artefacts is one part of a broader project: that of former imperial powers finding the language to deal properly with the dark periods of their history. In Britain, this work is urgent, and it has barely begun.</p> <p><strong>Provenance research</strong></p> <p>There is no point pretending that there are simple blanket rules, or simple possible answers. It is a meaningless absurdity to suggest that all objects held in museums should be returned to their point of origin; in most cases it would be impossible as well as undesirable (think of those Greek sculptures acquired by Roman conquerors now in Italian museums). To suggest that none may go is equally absurd: there are thousands of objects scattered through Britain alone, and very few are subject to restitution claims – there is no immediate danger of <em>après moi le déluge</em>. Equally, this is not a question only for national museums but significantly, in Britain, for regional collections and university museums such as Glasgow’s Hunterian and Oxford’s Pitt Rivers.</p> <p>There can be no resolution without knowledge. This is not glamorous, nor is it cheap; it is the slow, arduous work of provenance research, and museums must be equipped and resourced to undertake it. History, memory and dignity must to be restored to artefacts. Better, deeper stories need to be told to the public; the archive needs to be enriched. Where items are found to have been acquired wrongfully, restitution must follow. Museums lie at the root of these difficult and painful disputes over memory; they are also the places best able, in the end, to resolve them.</p>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1c8ddf8e71962970354e8f10822cfec583a3198/0_0_5568_3341/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"}]}}
