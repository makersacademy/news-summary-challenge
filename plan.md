USER STORIES

As a busy politician
So I know what the big stories of the day are
I can see all of today's headlines in one place

As a busy politician
So that I have something nice to look at
I can see a relevant picture to illustrate each news article when I browse headlines

As a busy politician
So I can get a few more details about an important story
I can click a news article title which links to the original article

As a busy politician
So I can search what I want to read about
I can specify a search query on the page and get articles matching this search

FOCUS ON THE FIRST THREE FIRST

///

MODEL (?):

- Array of article objects (with headline, image, section/topic)
- setArticles function to add articles from API calls to that array
- readArticles function to bring stored articles to the view

VIEW:

- Constructor (takes model and client as parameters), stores the relevant HTML sections as variables, has an event listener and search box for topic searches
- displayArticles function to procedurally generate a new 'div' for each article in the model array and append the article objects returned by the client (with the name as a hyperlink)
--- ASCERTAIN IF I NEED A MODEL CLASS, I might just need a displayArticlesFromAPI function that does what the above function does, but loadArticles from the client instead
- displayArticlesByTopic function that takes input from the constructor text box and returns articles with matching sectionName (ie. topic)

CLIENT:

- getArticles function which makes calls to the API and returns article objects formatted with headline, image, section/topic
- Test will need to involve mocking calls to the API, as the Guardian API is rate-limited
