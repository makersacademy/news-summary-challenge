- Make a front-end web app using javascript, HTML and css.
- The app must use an api to link to Guardian headlines and display these on the page.
- The display must contain a picture and the headline.
- When the picture or headline is clicked on it must take the user to another 'page'
where it displays the picture and summary of the article from another API.
- This is done without libraries or testing frameworks so need to write my own tests:
  * What behaviour will I be testing for?
  * I can create a function which handles the APIs within the interface so I don't need any logic behind that.
  * I can also link pictures in the interface
- You can then click from the summary page to the original article.
