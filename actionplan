Action plan:

1. DONE: read https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
2. DONE: serve an HTML page using http-server
3. DONE: Check caches are off
4. DONE: check out /images/news-summary-project-headlines-page-mockup.png, refer to it
5. What is curl? (try * cURL [man page](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html))
It's a tool to transfer data to and from a server using a protocol. Not exactly sure how its used though. I can see the hammer, I can see the nail. Do I pick up the hammer or try and drink it?

6. Go through the guardian API example... take notes on what you learn (*try [Guardian newspaper API homepage](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/)
)

We can use the makers API to connect to the guardian API... this gives us full news articles.

if I paste into a chrome terminal the link they gave me for the makers API, I get a response which is an object with loads of info, including the entire HTML page.

How will I send this request (and get this response) from my codebase?

I will need to look at the key or ID or something that relates to the value which is the contents and use that to render the page.
Appears to look like:

{"response":{"status":{"content":{"fields":{"body": all of the HTML

I think I will need to do something along the lines of document.getElementByID in order to reach the body, and then further the specific part of the body I am looking for...?


I might be an position to start thinking about a diagram.


7. Establish what the Aylien API is for

We can use the makers API to connect to the guardian API via the Aylien API... this gives us summaries of news articles.

8. If relevent, go through the Aylien example

9. Review, and set learning objectives

Don't feel I'm quite there to set a list of objectives yet.

New action plan:

1. Break it down... only one API first.
    - guardian one
2. In order to do one. lets rewrite and re-order the user stories.
    - only 2 user stories for MVP, start with headlines
    - What a lovely diagram
3. Review next steps.

New action plan

1. Create testing file
2. TDD making a change to the HTML page
   - This will involve creating a controller
   - This may involve creating a viewer
   - Plagurise code from notes
3. Begin looking at integrating the API
