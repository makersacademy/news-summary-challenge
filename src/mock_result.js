It was a joy to behold. </p> \n   <p>Goss , with a fearsome volley, and a header by Bowen reduced this illustrious home of German football to near-silence as Norwich led 20 after half an hour.</p> \n   <p>Nerlinger reduced the deficit before half-time with a goal that disappointed the Norwich manager Mike Walker, and indeed such is Bayern’s own away form that there is still danger to come in two weeks’ time. But this was a mighty achievement by City, because Bayern had never lost here in European competition against a British side.</p> \n   <p>The contrast between Norwich ‘s first European trip to Arnhem last month and their appearance in the Olympic Stadium could hardly have been more vivid. By further stark comparison this was Bayern’s 185th European tie, and Norwich ‘s third. They pack this huge bowl for the big ties but last night it was only a third or so full, the Bavarians not regarding Norwich as much more than a Uefa hors d’oevres. How wrong they were.</p> \n   <p>Norwich , again without the injured Polston and Ekoku, survived an awkward opening when in only the second minute Germany’s rising young talent Ziege crossed from the left to the near post and Witeczek struck an instant low shot uncomfortably close.</p> \n   <p>Bayern continued to edge forward with studious precision, across the enormous green spread of immaculate turf surrounded by steepling terracing. They probed for weaknesses with an unhurried ease born of years of top-flight competition. Norwich , to their immense credit, responded in similar vein, introducing their own passing game and waiting for the opportunity to counter within the limits of safety.</p> \n   <p>Just such an opportunity suddenly presented itself in the 12th minute when a long ball by Newman was headed out weakly by the sweeper Matthaus. Goss , who has discovered a remarkable goal-touch this season, struck the juiciest of volleys beyond Aumann. It was the sort of sublime start to gladden Norfolk hearts everywhere.</p> \n   <p>The thousand or so City supporters rose as one in their yellow and green, transposing a tiny corner of Carrow Road into a stadium that could swallow their Norwich home three or four times. It was a moment to savour, a moment neither the Norwich fans nor Goss will ever forget. The ordered world of European football shuddered.</p> \n   <p>Bayern sought to respond instantly, Valencia surging through the middle where Culverhouse was organising his defence with rare zeal and determination. Robins was lost to the battle early on through injury but nothing could deter Norwich who then, quite incredibly, forced a two-goal lead.</p> \n   <p>A free-kick by Crook, deep on the right, completely eluded the defence and Bowen, who always has an eye for goal, materialised at the far post to head firmly beyond Aumann. The Norwich bench catapulted into the air, arms flailing, voices soaring deliriously into the night skies. It seemed almost beyond belief. It was beyond belief.</p> \n   <p>The Bayern drums were still beating but now in a desultory, almost mournful fashion. The rhythm was picked up when Nerlinger had a shot blocked, although Norwich never appeared in any serious distress.</p> \n   <p>However, a typically patient cross-field build-up by Bayern finally bore fruit just before the interval when Nerlinger scored with a sharp header from a long cross by Bayern’s Brazilian full-back Jorginho.</p> \n   <p>Above all, Norwich needed to maintain their composure then and concentrate with an intensity not always possible in the helter-skelter of the domestic game. They had to think of the second leg. Not for once did Bayern forsake their own passing game and Gunn made a quite outstanding save from Valencia late in the second half, inspiring his fellow defenders to battle on.</p> \n   <p>Try as they might, Bayern could not break through again. ‘We showed true British grit,’ said Walker. ‘I told the players to always be positive. You can achieve anything if you really want it badly enough. I was always confident that we could do something here despite Bayern’s home record. Records are there to be broken.’</p> \n   <p><strong>Bayern Munich: </strong>Aumann, Jorginho, Ziege (Sternkopf, 60min), Kreuzer, Helmer, Nerlinger, Wouters, Witeczek, Valencia, Matthaus, Scholl (Labbadia, 65).<br><strong>Norwich City:</strong> Gunn, Culverhouse, Bowen, Butterworth, Prior, Newman, Robins (Sutch, 15), Crook, Sutton, Fox, Goss.<br><strong>Referee:</strong> L Sundell (Sweden).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5bc999afe4b0dfdbdb80ffcd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-19T08:55:16.502Z\">9.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And we start on the south coast, where both Bournemouth and Southampton have held their press conferences. Here’s what the Press Association wrote about Mark Hughes’s effort:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Southampton boss Mark Hughes says Bournemouth can no longer be regarded as top-flight minnows as Eddie Howe’s men challenge at the top of the Premier League. </p> \n   <p>The Cherries have made a fine start, winning five of their eight games to sit sixth entering this weekend, when they host Hughes’ Saints. </p> \n   <p>Asked about Howe’s impact at Bournemouth, who have been a top-flight club since being promoted as winners of the Championship in 2014-15, Hughes pointed to the Cherries’ expenditure, which this summer included the club-record purchase of 25million midfielder Jefferson Lerma. </p> \n   <p>“He’s been there a long time. He’s got longevity. That helps if you’re trying to build a club,” Hughes said. </p> \n   <p>“He’s benefited from significant investment as well. It’s not ‘little old Bournemouth’. They have spent a lot of money. And clearly you’ve got to spend that well. </p> \n   <p>“They’re playing well. They’ve got a lot of confidence. They’ve added good quality once again. </p> \n   <p>“They’ve got good pace in almost every position now. That lends itself to the way they want to play. They want to be high tempo, on the front foot.” </p> \n   <p>Hughes played down the derby tag to the fixture, saying Portsmouth are Saints’ rivals. </p> \n   <p>The Welshman is confident his side can match Bournemouth, despite Saints having won just one of their eight games so far. </p> \n   <p>Southampton also have lost their last three league games, conceding eight times without reply. </p> \n   <p>Hughes added: “Big test (against Bournemouth), but one we’re more than capable of matching, as long as we reach our levels. </p> \n   <p>“We don’t think we’re a million miles away. We’ve been frustrated, because in games where we’ve done really well we haven’t capitalised and got the points we felt we deserved. </p> \n   <p>“We need to accept that, understand that’s sport sometimes, but you’ve still got to go out and get points on the board. </p> \n   <p>“That’s our intention. We’ve just come through a period of eight games where we expected a better return. </p> \n   <p>“We’re not a million miles away. There’s enough quality in this group to start getting points on the board. We all feel that.” </p> \n   <p>Goalkeeper Alex McCarthy is available after withdrawing from England duty with tightness in his hamstrings. Hughes reported no other fitness issues. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5bc995a0e4b0c2d58c1b2dfc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-19T08:38:24.983Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hello world!</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>What a Friday we have in store!

At Thursday’s rally, Trump said that anyone who could perform a body-slam, as Gianforte did on Jacobs, was “my guy”, and that news of the attack, which occurred the night before the special election, probably helped Gianforte win.</p> \n<p>Trump finished his account of the physical assault by saying of Gianforte: “He’s a great guy. Tough cookie.” The partisan crowd at the rally in Missoula in western Montana clapped and cheered.</p> \n<p>Axios national political reporter Jonathan Swan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonathanvswan/status/1053096082069164032\">replied</a>: “Nothing tough about jumping a reporter for asking you a substantive question.

I saw one young man in the crowd making body-slam gestures. He looked at me and ran his thumb across his throat. I talked to him after the rally was over. He couldn’t stop laughing.”</p> \n<p>A number of journalists pointed out how Trump’s comments are especially troubling this week, coming as evidence mounts that Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is directly linked to the presumed murder of journalist and Saudi critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\">Jamal Khashoggi</a> in Istanbul earlier this month.</p> \n<p>“Tonight [Trump] celebrates an assault on a reporter in Montana at the same time as his Administration tries to minimize the murder of a reporter in Turkey.

Here’s why | Roy Greenslade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Macron started off this week’s European council with a show of goodwill. At the opening of the summit in Brussels, on Wednesday, Macron said he wanted to send a “message of trust, and of urgency”. “Progress has been made, but we’re not there yet. We must decide now,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/1052636328565923842\" title=\"\">he said</a>, adding that he hoped Theresa May would explain “what is possible” to unblock the deadlocked talks.</p> <p>But little happened, and May’s presentation to the EU27 was deemed underwhelming – relaxed in tone yet devoid of new content. At a press conference yesterday, Macron made clear that the EU had done its best to find a deal and would continue to do so, but that deep down, it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/18/juncker-extension-brexit-transition-period-probably-will-happen\" title=\"\">up to the UK</a> to make a choice.</p> <p>There is fatigue on the EU’s side of the negotiations. Since 2016, the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/05/european-parliament-red-lines-resolution-brexit-negotiations\" title=\"\"> European red lines</a> have not moved an inch: there can be no cherry picking of the single market’s four freedoms of people, capital, services and goods; there cannot be a hard border in Ireland. “The EU has already shown efficacy and flexibility,” Macron said at the European council. “We do not want a deal that would undermine the integrity of the single market, or the four freedoms, or that would be damaging to Ireland.” He was only repeating what the EU made clear on day one of the Brexit process.</p> <p>But day one is long gone.

Never.”</p> \n<p>Trump’s comments mark the first time the president has openly and directly praised a violent act against a journalist on American soil.

This was the day of the election or just before, and I thought, ‘Oh, this is terrible!

But if you flip that around, by dealing with air pollution we are also starting to deal with climate change, and that is a great opportunity as well as a great challenge.”</p> <p>The UK government has been widely criticised by clean air campaigners and environmental groups over what they say has been its failure to tackle the air pollution crisis. It has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/21/high-court-rules-uk-air-pollution-plans-unlawful\">defeated three times in court</a> over its plans on the issue and is now one of six countries taken to the European court of justice over their toxic air.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs defended the government’s record, claiming the UK was<strong> “</strong>acting faster to tackle air pollution than almost every other major developed economy, with an ambitious £3.5bn plan to reduce harmful emissions”.</p> <p>It also called on individuals to take action, from burning only the “cleanest fuels” to “leaving the car at home on the school run”.</p> <p>However, Boyd said ministers were “simply not doing enough”.</p> <p>“The fact that they still have these weak standards and the fact that there are somewhere between 30,000 and 50,000 premature deaths in the UK?” he said. “That should simply not be acceptable in a wealthy, advanced society.”</p> <p>And he warned that the official death toll was “just the tip of the iceberg”.</p> <p>“If you are having tens of thousands of premature deaths,” he said, “you are also talking about millions of illnesses from asthma to lung cancer that don’t necessarily kill you but make lives utterly miserable.”</p> <p>Boyd, who took up his post in August, said the crisis in the UK was part of a global public health emergency that kills between 6 and 7 million people a year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/18/air-pollution-in-schools-children-breathing-dirty-air\">'I was horrified that children are breathing air this dirty inside the school'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He argued that the “vast majority” of these deaths are preventable “if we put stronger laws, policies and standards in place … we just need the political will.”</p> <p>Children are among the most susceptible to toxic air. Last month the Guardian reported how youngsters in the UK were getting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/18/school-run-air-pollution-children-black-carbon\">a disproportionate amount of air pollution during the school day</a>.

The Norwegian cautiously halved against the world No 3, Shak Mamedyarov, then tried for a full point against the low-rated Alexander Donchenko, but miscalculated and had to settle for perpetual check.</p> \n<p>His game against Ding was heading for a quiet handshake until Carlsen suddenly blundered an endgame pawn. Thereafter it became a comedy of mutual errors until the champion escaped with a repetition of moves.</p> \n<p>It added up to unimpressive form, which contrasted with Fabiano Caruana’s commanding play on top board for the US at the Batumi Olympiad, and is reflected in changes in the betting market for their €1m, 12-game world title series which starts in London on 9 November.</p> \n<p>Carlsen has slipped from a strong 1-3 favourite to around 1-2, with Caruana shortening to around 7-4. The challenger remains the outsider due to Carlsen’s three previous title wins and his perceived advantage if the match is tied 6-6 and decided by a speed play-off.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Ding continues his inexorable unbeaten sequence which now totals 94 games, just one shy of the legendary Mikhail Tal’s mark achieved in 1973-74. It looks strange for the risk-on attacking genius to hold such a record, but Tal’s style matured in his later years.</p> \n<p>There are other claimants. On the criteria of years without defeat, José Raúl Capablanca’s 63 games unbeaten from 1916 to 1924 stands alone. The period coincided with a world war, but also included his world title victory over Emanuel Lasker and his dominating performance at London 1922. More recently Bogdan Lalic, the Croatian GM resident in Surrey, and Sergei Tiviakov, the 2008 European champion, both claim runs of 110 games. Tiviakov wrote that after passing the 100-game mark “it became difficult for me to sleep, since I started to believe in my invincibility”.</p> \n<p>Despite Carlsen’s moderate form, his fifth-seeded Valerenga Oslo team led the Eurocup with one round to go, but their final round loss to St Petersburg gave the Russian team the title.</p> \n<p>As expected, the five British clubs fought hard and finished in the middle or the lower half of the table. Wood Green did best, aided by a fine individual top board performance by Jon Speelman, who at age 62 scored an unbeaten 4.5/6.</p> \n<p>Ding Liren’s win over Peter Svidler was in the context of a dreadful run by the eight-time Russian champion, who lost his first four games at the Eurocup. It was probably a career-worst sequence, and explains Black’s punch-drunk opening. Ding’s anti-Grunfeld 3 f3 has scored well after d5 4 cxd5 Nxd5 5 e4 Nb6 6 Nc3 Bg7 7 Be3, but 3…Nc6?! is a poor answer as Black gets an inferior version of the King’s Indian Four Pawns Attack without the usual counterplay against White’s pawn phalanx, which soon led to the thematic 14 e5!</p> \n<p>Svidler made it worse by avoiding the 17…Qxd4 endgame, so that Ding’s d5/e5 duo dominated the board leading to 27 Qe4! and a better version of the queen trade. Ding could have won faster by 32 Bxf6! Bxf6 33 Nxf6+ Kg7 34 g5 h6 35 gxh6+ Kxh6 36 d6 and the d pawn queens. As played, Svidler’s knight was trapped at a2 and he resigned due to the coming 42 Ra3.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"00efea4d-ef70-40f2-bd5a-b8de00507129\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Ding Liren v Peter Svidler, Eurocup 2018<br>1</b>&nbsp;d4 Nf6&nbsp;<b>2</b>&nbsp;c4 g6&nbsp;<b>3</b>&nbsp;f3 Nc6?!&nbsp;<b>4</b>&nbsp;d5 Ne5&nbsp;<b>5</b>&nbsp;e4 d6&nbsp;<b>6</b>&nbsp;Nc3 c6&nbsp;<b>7</b>&nbsp;f4 Ned7&nbsp;<b>8</b>&nbsp;Nh3!

It seems like a stupid question. Obviously, it’s because they really matter. Yet, on closer inspection, that can’t be the whole story. All sorts of other decisions “really matter”, too: whether to seek medical help when you break your leg; whether to use an oven glove to handle an extremely hot dish; whether to park your car on a level crossing. But they’re not agonising at all. They’re so straightforward that it sounds strange even to think of them as decisions.</p> <p>All right, then. Perhaps what makes decisions agonising is that they matter <em>and </em>there is too much uncertainty to know which option to choose. That sounds more reasonable. But as the US psychology professor Tania Lombrozo <a href=\"https://npr.org/sections/13.7/2017/04/17/524386548/why-hard-decisions-should-be-easy-but-aren-t\" title=\"\">points out</a>, it’s still a bit weird. If no single option clearly stands out – if they’re roughly equally appealing and you can’t reduce the uncertainty by doing further research – then your decision <em>doesn’t</em> much matter. You could just flip a coin. Or, as Lombrozo puts it: “Hard decisions should be easy.”</p> <p>This is <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/fredkins-paradox-explains-why-you-waste-time-on-meaning-1629941418\" title=\"\">Fredkin’s </a><a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/fredkins-paradox-explains-why-you-waste-time-on-meaning-1629941418\" title=\"\">paradox</a>, proposed by the computer scientist Edward Fredkin, whose colleague Marvin Minsky quoted him as follows: “The more equally attractive two alternatives seem, the harder it can be to choose between them – no matter that, to the same degree, the choice can only matter less.”</p> <p>Every bone in our bodies rails against the idea of choosing a spouse or a career the way you’d choose between spaghetti bolognese or pizza margherita. Yet to the extent that you’re unable to know how things will turn out, overthinking is futile: it can’t affect what economists call your “expected utility”. Certainly, it’ll turn out to have mattered in hindsight – but by then it’ll be too late. Hence the paradox: we fret and stew, as if hoping through sheer effort to see into the future. In the worst case, we end up choosing none of the potentially good options, but a definitively bad one – paralysis – instead. That is the fate of “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan%27s_ass\" title=\"\">Buridan’s ass”</a>, the hypothetical donkey, positioned equidistantly between hay and water, that is hungry and thirsty in equal measure and stays rooted to the spot, thus starving to death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/05/secret-of-productivity-time-management-theory\">Is the secret of productivity really just doing what you enjoy? | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Merely knowing about Fredkin’s paradox probably won’t reduce your tendency to overthinking: it’s too deeply conditioned for that. But it can provide solace, I think, when a decision turns out to have been bad. If you’re tempted to berate yourself, wondering how you could have chosen such a disastrous job, or spouse, or place to live, you can remind yourself that you truly couldn’t have known. Your agonised decision-making process may have made it <em>feel</em> like you were weighing the pros and cons, a task you should have performed better, but really you were taking a stab in the dark.</p> <p>The philosopher Alan Watts once observed that the process we call “deciding” – moving gradually towards a resolution – is frequently no such thing. Rather, it’s just a period of flipping back and forth between options, followed by a sudden, intuitive, semi-random choice.

He had </strong><strong>radiotherapy and then a heart operation. </strong><strong>He got back on his feet and we resumed a regular sex life, but there was no spontaneity any more due to the medication he was taking. Then, last autumn, </strong><strong>he got bladder cancer. Two operations later, he is still recovering. We are now in our 60s and he has suddenly aged</strong><strong>.

Could this be an opportunity to experiment with different ways of being intimate – using sex toys, for example? Is it that you don’t want to, or that your husband isn’t interested?”</p> <p>It wasn’t clear, though, how much you have talked to your husband about this. I’m sure you know that intimacy is about more than sex. “Regardless of the sexual difficulties, communication is key,” Woodbridge said. “Make sure you leave as much space for him to express how he feels, as you do for yourself.” She also wondered if there was “a wider issue here, beyond the orgasm?”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/28/my-mother-abused-me-as-a-child-can-i-report-her-now-\">My mother abused me as a child.
