temporarily suspended clinical trials of a Covid vaccine made by Chinese drug giant Sinopharm after detecting neurological problems in one of its test volunteers, Agence France-Presse reports.</p> \n  <p>The country’s National Institute of Health said Friday that it had decided to interrupt the trial after a volunteer had difficulty moving their arms, according to local media.</p> \n  <p>“Several days ago we signalled, as we are required, to the regulatory authorities that one of our participants (in trials) presented neurological symptoms which could correspond to a condition called Guillain-Barre syndrome,” said the chief researcher, German Malaga, in comments to the press.</p> \n  <p>Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare and non-contagious disorder which affects the movement of the arms and legs. Peru declared a temporary health emergency in five regions in June last year following multiple cases.</p> \n  <p>In the 1970s a campaign to innoculate Americans against a supposedly devastating strain of swine flu ground to a halt after some 450 of those vaccinated developed the syndrome, which can also cause paralysis.</p> \n  <p>Peru’s clinical trials for the Sinopharm vaccine were due to conclude this week, after testing around 12,000 people.</p> \n  <p>If they are successful – which won’t be known until mid-2021 – the Peruvian government was expected to buy up to 20m doses to inoculate two-thirds of its population.</p> \n  <p>Some 60,000 people across the globe have already taken the Sinopharm vaccine, including volunteers in Argentina, Russia and Saudi Arabia.</p> \n  <p>Peru has one of the world’s highest per capita death rates from the virus, which as of Friday had caused 36,499 deaths and 979,111 infections.</p> \n  <p>The pandemic has hit the South American country’s economy hard, with GDP plunging more than 30% in the second quarter.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-12-12T06:55:49.339Z\">at 6.55am

after two local infections involving workers at a port and trade zone respectively, authorities have said.</p> \n  <p>Both cities recorded a new case, and sit on the border with Russia. </p> \n  <p>In Dongning, a 40-year-old maintenance worker at a port tested positive on Thursday, triggering the latest measures.<br></p> \n  <p>Officials there said on Saturday it would enter “wartime mode” – temporarily suspending public bus services and road transport, while requiring anyone leaving the city to produce a negative Covid-19 test from the preceding 24 hours.</p> \n  <p>Schools will suspend classes and dine-in will be banned at restaurants, while in higher-risk areas only one member of each household will be allowed to leave the home once every two days to buy daily necessities – for no longer than two hours each time.</p> \n  <p>In the Suifenhe case, a 39-year-old man who works as a loading and unloading worker at a trade zone tested positive.</p> \n  <p>Both cities on Friday announced the launch of citywide testing, expected to be completed in three days.</p> \n  <p>State media blamed the recent clusters on imports of frozen food and other shipments.<br></p> \n  <p>After

Zhou </strong>here on the blog. Thanks to my colleague <strong>Michael McGowan</strong> for all his work today. </p> \n  <p><strong>Australia</strong>’s acting chief medical officer, <strong>Prof Paul Kelly</strong>, has just been on the ABC and said Australia will not rush through the Pfizer vaccine that has been given emergency approval in the US and UK. </p> \n  <p>Earlier today, the US president, <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, announced the emergency approval and said the first US citizens would be vaccinated in 24 hours. </p> \n  <p>Kelly said that Australia had ordered the Pfizer vaccine, but “we will be going through the full regulatory process”.</p> \n  <p>Australia also has millions of doses of the Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine to be rolled out in March. </p> \n  <p>Kelly said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[It is] quite a different situation in the UK, in Canada and now in the United States in terms of what is happening with the pandemic and their need ...</p> \n   <p>But to just stress, this is not full approval that the FDA has given and neither has the UK, neither has Canada. These are emergency authorisations to allow the vaccine to roll out. </p> \n   <p>Also overnight, and this is part of the reason why the FDA is confident to give that authorisation, in the New England Journal of Medicine, one of the premier medical journals in the world, Pfizer has reported on their phase three trial results, their interim results, and it is very encouraging. We have heard some of the headlines before, but there is now more detail and it is peer-reviewed scientific literature, and that is how to move forward, with scientific expertise. Ninety-five per cent effective, effective in old and young people, effective in healthy and people with chronic disease and a very good safety profile.</p> \n   <p>These are interim results and we will get more detail and much more detail will come to the Therapeutic Goods Administration to allow them to make their own independent assessment of these matters and give us regulatory approval and confidence that we absolutely need for any new vaccine, that it is safe and effective.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-12-12T04:49:19.370Z\">at 4.49am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5fd4409a8f08a72f01ad84e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-12-12T04:02:09.241Z\">4.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That is where I will leave you for today.

stripped bare of toilet paper at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, AFP reports that in <strong>Albania</strong> it is donkey milk that has seen a rise in demand. </p> \n  <p>Touted as rich in vitamins and a boost for the immune system, the high-priced milk has been flying off the shelves during the coronavirus pandemic – a time when many in Albania are looking for an extra health kick.</p> \n  <p>“The demand for donkey milk is rising sharply” alongside virus infections, says 37-year-old Elton Kikia, the manager of the small farm in the village of Paper, where around a dozen of the small, knobbly-kneed animals romp around a green pasture.</p> \n  <p>The high demand is good news for the donkeys themselves, whose comfortable lifestyle on the farm is a welcome respite from their traditional roles as beasts of burden.</p> \n  <p>Typically enlisted to carry heavy loads and pull carts through Albania’s mountainous terrain, donkeys are frequently subject to mistreatment, in the form of beatings, overwork or saddle sores.</p> \n  <p>“Yet it is a very delicate animal, which to produce its milk needs tenderness and love,” Kikia told AFP.</p> \n  <p>Two years ago he left his job as a journalist to take over the family farm, which is only one of two in the country to raise donkeys for their milk.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

have set off a flurry of interest.</p> \n  <p>While no one is branding the milk as a cure for the virus, aficionados are convinced its nutritional profile – which is close to human milk – helps strengthen the body’s natural defences.</p> \n  <p>Klea Ymeri, a student in agro-environmental engineering, recently travelled to Paper to buy two 250ml bottles to help her parents recover from Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>“On top of the medicines they are taking, donkey’s milk could be a good natural remedy for the respiratory system”, she told AFP.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

As authorities press ahead with logistical plans for the country’s biggest ever public health programme, the Church of England said offers by churches to turn over their buildings were “a great act of service and witness”. You can read the full story here: The pandemic has illuminated deprivation, inequalities and political unrest, while reminding us of the power and beauty of nature and humanity, writes Jonathan Freedland in this piece, which explores what the coronavirus pandemic revealed about our world. Peru has suspended trials of China’s Sinopharm coronavirus vaccine due to a “serious adverse event” that occurred with one of the volunteers for the study, the Peruvian government has said. The country’s health ministry said the event is “under investigation to determine if it is related to the vaccine or if there is another explanation.” The trial, which involves 12,000 volunteers, was due to complete its first phase in the next few days. This is not the vaccine which has begun to be administered in the UK. Peru has lost 36,544 lives to the coronavirus pandemic so far. The head of the US Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn, said he was ready for a vaccination as soon as available and defended the speed of the vaccine development. Speaking during a press conference, Hahn said the agency did not sacrifice safety in return for speed. He also denounced press reports that said the Trump administration had threatened to fire him if the FDA did not approve the authorisation by a certain date as “inaccurate”. Supermarkets in the UK are to use digital queueing systems, 24-hour trading, door marshals and incentives to shop early in an attempt to provide socially distanced shopping during what is expected to be their biggest ever Christmas sales period. With government restrictions to control coronavirus limiting eating out and pub visits, British shoppers are expected to spend a record £12bn in supermarkets and convenience stores in December, about £1.5bn more than last year, according to analysts at Kantar. But social distancing measures mean retailers must cap the number of shoppers in their stores at any one time, prompting fears that the Christmas rush could result in long queues and angry customers. You can read the full report here: In the UK, the Labour party has called for the pay freeze affecting many key workers to be scrapped, in recognition of their work during the coronavirus pandemic. “They’ve worked long hours, put themselves at risk and sacrificed time with their families to serve their community and country. Many have tragically lost their lives,” a Labour petition said. “Now, the government is freezing their wages.” “The government is handing out millions of pounds worth of contracts to its wealthy friends and donors – but won’t give key workers what they deserve,” it added. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has urged world leaders to “stop the assault” on the planet and declare a state of climate emergency in their countries until they have become carbon neutral. “Today, we are 1.2C hotter than before the Industrial Revolution. If we don’t change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3C this century,” he said. “Can anybody still deny that we are facing a dramatic emergency? “That is why today, I call on all leaders worldwide to declare a state of climate emergency in their countries until carbon neutrality is reached.” He said that the world needs meaningful cuts now to reduce global emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels. Johnson said the UK was committed to reducing carbon emissions by 68% on 1990 levels, and encouraged countries around the world to work together over the climate emergency. “Lets do it together, lets make it our collective commitment … to get to net zero by 2030,” he said. In true Boris Johnson style, he added: “We’re not doing this because we’re hair-shirt-wearing, tree-hugging, mung bean-munching eco-freaks,” though he insisted he had nothing against those people and assumed that mung beans were very nice. Instead, Johnson said his motivation was to save the environment and create new jobs following the deep damage done to economies around the world by the coronavirus pandemic. “We are doing it because we know that scientific advances will allow us, collectively as humanity to save our planet and create millions of high-skilled jobs as we recover from Covid,” he said. Johnson also heralded the scientific breakthrough of the coronavirus vaccine. “We are coming to the end of an extraordinary year with I think a sudden surge of scientific optimism, because of after barely 12 months of the pandemic we are seeing the vaccine going into the arms of the elderly and the vulnerable,” he said. “Vaccines that are the produce, each and everyone of them, of vast international efforts in laboratories around the world and my message to you all is that together we can use scientific advances to protect our entire planet, our biosphere against a challenge far worse, far more destructive than coronavirus.” The coronavirus pandemic has caused a drop in greenhouse gas emissions, but experts expect the levels to rebound in 2021 as lockdowns end. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, is currently speaking at the UN climate summit, which is being held virtually due to the pandemic. You can watch live here: A further 476 individuals have tested positive for coronavirus in Northern Ireland over the past 24 hours, and another 9 deaths have been reported, the Department of Health has said. There are not enough nurses to safely care for patients in the UK, according to the body that oversees the profession, and many of those who are working are suffering from anxiety and burnout after a gruelling nine months treating Covid patients. A year after the prime minister pledged during the 2019 election campaign to add 50,000 nurses to the NHS, the Royal College of Nursing has accused Boris Johnson of being “disingenuous” for claiming the government is meeting this 2025 target. Johnson claimed last week that the government had “14,800 of the 50,000 nurses already” during prime minister’s questions in the Commons. Yet the latest NHS figures show there were 36,655 vacancies for nursing staff in England in September, with the worst shortages affecting mental health care and acute hospitals. Staff in some intensive care units (ICUs) have quit since the pandemic, with those whom the Observer spoke to choosing to work instead in supermarkets or as dog-walkers. Read the full report here: The British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has agreed to buy the US drugmaker Alexion Pharmaceuticals for $39bn in cash and shares, in an attempt to bolster its work in immunology and rare diseases. AstraZeneca is one of the frontrunners in the race for a coronavirus vaccine, and said on Saturday that Alexion shareholders would receive $60 in cash and 2.1243 AstraZeneca American depositary shares (ADSs) for each Alexion share. “This acquisition allows us to enhance our presence in immunology,” AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said in a statement. “Alexion has established itself as a leader in complement biology, bringing life-changing benefits to patients with rare diseases.” The firm said the boards of both companies had approved the deal, but it remains subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. It is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021. Here’s a summary of key developments in the global coronavirus pandemic over the past few hours: Schools in England could face legal action if they attempt to switch to online learning in the run up to Christmas. Dogs are being trained to sniff out coronavirus, following indications they can detect illnesses such as malaria. Japan has recorded more than 3,000 new coronavirus infections in a day for the first time. The World Bank has approved a $300m loan for Ukraine to help support low-income families during the pandemic. Wales is facing an “incredibly serious situation”, its health minister Vaughan Gething said, warning of “rising tide of infections”. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is to meet state leaders on Sunday to discuss tightening lockdown restrictions as the number of new coronavirus cases continues to rise. Up to 40% of care workers in the UK might refuse to have the coronavirus vaccine, Nadra Ahmed, the chair of the National Care Association, said. Community testing will be introduced in parts of England on Monday, as the government pushes to identify asymptomatic cases and bring down the transmission rate. Poland is hoping to administer 3.4m doses of coronavirus vaccine a month, the prime minister’s top aide said on Saturday. The operation is likely to be the biggest logistical challenge the country’s health service has ever faced. Michal Dworczyk told a news conference that 8,319 vaccination teams had applied to take part in the programme. He had previously said there could be around 8,000 vaccination points in Poland. The number of new coronavirus cases in Poland has fallen after a surge in October and early November, but the number of deaths has remained high, frequently exceeding 500 a day. Schools in England which are planning to allow pupils to learn remotely in the run-up to Christmas could face legal action to force them to provide in-person teaching. New powers introduced through the Coronavirus Act allow the government to issue directives to headteachers on teaching during the pandemic. If schools fail to comply with directives to stay open, the government could apply for a high court injunction. The Department for Education said the move would only be used as a “last resort”. A headteacher in Ware, Hertfordshire, whose school was planning to switch to remote learning in the run-up to the festive break, was sent a “minded to direct” letter from the schools minister, Nick Gibb, warning that the emergency powers could be used. The school changed its approach following the letter. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, criticised the approach. He said it marked “a low moment when a government threatens legal action against its own school and college leaders, all of whom have worked tirelessly throughout this crisis to make sense of last-minute and chaotic decisions from Westminster. “The government’s approach undermines the much-vaunted trust it once said it had for leaders and governors in their communities to make the right decisions on behalf of their pupils, parents and staff.” You can read more here: It’s no secret that dogs have a remarkable sense of smell. They have already been used to detect drugs and weapons in police forces, but their recent feat might be their most impressive yet. Dogs are being trained to smell coronavirus, following indications that they can sniff out other illnesses such as cancer and malaria. “Viruses themselves do not produce odours. When the virus has infected our cells, this can have a knock-on effect on various systems within the body, which results in odours being released through our skin and breath. So there was a really strong likelihood that coronavirus would produce a distinct odour as well,” one expert said. Meet the super sniffer canines here: The head of the Hanoi Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Vietnam has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for overstating the cost of coronavirus equipment. Nguyen Nhat Cam, 57, was found guilty of overstating the cost of Covid-19 testing systems during a transaction, causing a loss of 5.4 billion dong (around £17,000) to the state budget, the Ministry of Public Security said in a statement. Nine other people were also sentenced to between three and 6-1/2 years in prison for their involvement in the incident. The ministry said that the actions of Cam and his accomplices would negatively impact the image of doctors and the anti-coronavirus agency. With its strict quarantine and tracking measures, Vietnam has managed to quickly contain outbreaks of coronavirus. It has registered a total of 1,395 cases and 35 deaths. Japan has recorded more than 3,000 new coronavirus infections in a single day for the first time, the public broadcaster NHK reported. A total of 3,041 people were newly infected, with the capital of Tokyo confirming 621 new cases. Japan has not suffered as seriously from the pandemic as countries such as the UK and the US, but infections have increased as winter has set in. So far, 2,588 people have died of Covid-19 in Japan. With some London boroughs currently recording more than twice the average case rate for England, calls are growing for the capital to move into tier 3 restrictions. Some experts on the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) say privately that London should have moved straight into tier 3 after the end of England’s national lockdown on 2 December. Pressure is also mounting from the north of England. With many areas in the north enduring months of tier-3-level restrictions, it will seem deeply unfair if the capital avoids the same fate. So should London move into tier 3, and more pressingly, will it? My colleagues explore in this report: Some people are taking up new hobbies, others are bingeing television, but people in Estonia have come up with an unusual way of keeping their spirits up during coronavirus restrictions: swimming on mass in near-freezing waters. More than 500 swimmers took to the icy waters of Tallinn port in Estonia on Friday as part of a giant winter swimming relay. The sport has been a popular escape from the tedium of Covid restrictions. The participants each swam the 25-metre course in a former submarine dockyard. The swimmers, many attired with funny hats, ranged from a nine-year old boy to an 83-year old woman. Aivar Tugedam, one of the event’s organisers said the country’s coronavirus lockdown had triggered a huge rise in interest in the sport. “Let’s say from spring until now, I would say the count of the winter swimmers have tripled in Estonia. It’s gone wild and really popular,” he said. Anyone fancy a dip? A year after Chinese scientists alerted their colleagues to a new virus, what do we know about the origins of coronavirus? The first clue was the market, but what looked like a slam dunk at first is now uncertain. Of a sample of 41 early confirmed cases, 70% were stall owners, employees or regular customers of the Huanan market, which sold seafood but also live animals, often illegally captured in the wild and slaughtered in front of the customer. But the first confirmed case had no apparent connection. The Guardian’s health editor Sarah Boseley reports: Festive lights twinkle on the outside terrace of Upminster’s Osteria Due Amici Italian restaurant with outdoor tables placed beneath heaters, and indoor tables separated by Perspex screens. Owner Edward Xhetani, 38, has done everything to entice customers and be Covid-compliant. It was due to be fully booked on Friday night. “But if we go into tier 3, I’m done. That’s the truth. I don’t have a chance,” he said. At the furthest eastern reach of the District line, Upminster lies in the London borough of Havering, where coronavirus infection rates are among the highest in the capital. You can read the full report here: Overseas tourism to the UK is expected to pick up in early 2021 after a significant slump caused by the coronavirus, but is unlikely to reach pre-pandemic levels all year, the British tourism board has said. Visit Britain forecasts a gradual increase in the value of inbound tourism from January to March, but it is not expected to reach normal levels, even by the end of 2021. The body also suggested there could be 16.9m inbound visits in 2021 - an increase of 73% on this year, but less than half of the 40.9m in 2019. Inbound visitor spending is forecast to reach £9bn next year, an increase of 59% on 2020 but less than a third of the all-time spending high of £28.4bn in 2019. The tourism minister, Nigel Huddleston, said the government was committed to bringing inbound tourism back to full strength. Relaxing coronavirus restrictions throughout the UK over Christmas is a mistake which will have consequences, a public health expert has said. Linda Bauld, a professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said she was concerned about the impact of people travelling from areas with high infections to areas with lower rates of transmission, and taking the virus with them. In the UK, three households are allowed to meet between December 23 and 27. “From a public health perspective, I have to be perfectly honest, I think this is a mistake,” Prof Bauld said. “I think people have to think very carefully whether they can see loved ones outside, or do it in a very modest way.” Bauld said she understood why governments had chosen to make the move, because people were “fed up”, but that it was a risk. Bauld is not the only expert to raise concerns about the policy; a number of scientists and government advisers have urged people to rethink Christmas plans and ignore the easing of regulations amid fears over rising cases and hospitalisations. You can read more about Christmas concerns and the current data on coronavirus in the UK here: Italy could soon reclaim the undesirable record of having the highest death toll in Europe. It was the first western country to suffer badly with coronavirus, and it was hoped that greater experience with the virus would equip the country to cope with further waves of the pandemic. However, Italy has lost a further 28,000 lives since 1 September. Italy counted a further 761 victims on Friday, bringing its official total to 63,387. This is narrowly short of Britain’s 63,603 deaths, currently the highest in Europe. Both numbers are likely to considerably underestimate the true tolls, due to unrecorded infections with limited testing and different counting criteria. After Japan, Italy has the world’s second-oldest population, with the elderly at high risk from coronavirus. The average age of Italian victims of coronavirus is around 80. Roughly 65% of those who died in Italy had three or more other health problems, such as hypertension or diabetes, before they tested positive, according to Italy’s Superior Institute of Health. However, this doesn’t provide a full explanation; Germany has a similarly old demographic and yet its death toll is one-third of Italy’s, despite its larger population of 83 million. Germany spends more on healthcare so has greater ICU capacity, more doctors and nurses proportional to the population, and better testing capacities. It also imposed a lockdown earlier, and its measures were more stringent. The World Bank has approved a loan of $300m for Ukraine to help support low-income families during the coronavirus pandemic. “The new funds will help finance Ukraine’s Covid-19 social protection emergency response by introducing fast cash transfers to individuals and households who have lost their jobs or income sources because of the pandemic,” the World Bank said in a statement late on Friday night. Ukraine was given $150m in April as part of the Social Safety Nets Modernization Project. The bank predicts poverty in Ukraine could increase by 4%, reaching around 23% by the end of 2020. The country has registered 12,811 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number to 885,039. Almost 15,000 people have died in Ukraine since the start of the pandemic. Wales is facing an “incredibly serious situation” over the coronavirus pandemic, the health minister, Vaughan Gething, has said. There had been a “rising tide of infections” since the relaxation of rules on 9 November, he said. “This is hugely serious. It’s for all of us to play our part,” he told BBC Breakfast. “All those people doing the right thing should keep on doing that. Everyone needs to think again about how many people they are seeing, what contact they are having with them, and think about how you can reduce your contact to protect yourself and each other.” Gething said that while the Welsh government could theoretically break the agreement between Westminster and the devolved administrations to relax social distancing rules for five days over the festive period, it would cause a loss of trust. “There are huge issues here about trust in the government. If we were to upset those rules, we would lose lots of trust from a large number of people who have stuck with us, and we would also see, I’m afraid, a range of people prepared to ignore the rules,” he said. “Even with the agreement in place we’re likely to see a number of people go beyond that anyway. That’s why we are anticipating an increase after Christmas and why I expect there will be an increase after New Year’s Eve as well.” The UK government needs to make swifter progress in getting rapid coronavirus tests to English care homes to allow visits over Christmas, a leading care director has said. Mike Padgham, the chair of the Independent Care Group and boss of four care homes in North Yorkshire, said “time was running out” to get relatives to be able to visit their loved ones in care homes over the festive period. “We haven’t had all the tests delivered yet. We want to get visiting up and running as soon as possible but time is running out because Christmas is a short time away,” he said. “It’s quite a laborious exercise; we’ve got to be trained, each test takes 45 minutes to an hour to do. “I fear some people will be disappointed. Even if we started today and I did 20 visits a day I still wouldn’t get through to everyone by Christmas. We will somehow reunite people as much as we can.” But Caroline Abrahams, the director of the Age UK charity, told BBC Breakfast that “not all care homes are as keen on getting visiting going”. “Some of the big chains are more risk-averse. Probably partly because they have got their insurance breathing down their necks,” she said. “We have heard some people say: ‘Why don’t we wait until the vaccine comes?’ That would mean another really lengthy delay for families and older people.” The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is to meet state leaders on Sunday to discuss tightening lockdown restrictions amid a rising number of coronavirus infections. Germany has been in a partial lockdown for six weeks, with bars and restaurants closed but shops and schools remaining open. However, as the number of coronavirus infections rise, some regions have already imposed tougher measures. Merkel is expected to discuss measures such as closing shops before Christmas, sources “familiar with the matter” told the Reuters news agency. On Saturday, the economic affairs minister, Peter Altmaier, said hospital intensive care units were reaching their peak capacity, and that measures must be introduced before Christmas “otherwise the pandemic will get completely out of control”. Up to 40% of care workers in the UK might refuse to have the coronavirus vaccine, Nadra Ahmed, the chair of the National Care Association, said. “We know that between 50%-60%, depending on individual services, the staff are actually saying they will definitely have the vaccine and are very keen,” she told BBC Radio 4. “We understand between about 17-20% of staff in services are saying they definitely won’t have it, and then you have the rest who are waiting to see. So we are looking at potentially 40% who decide not to have it.” “I do think people will start to change their minds as the vaccine becomes more readily available and they see colleagues having it,” Ahmed added. “I think the uncertainty rests somewhere around fear but then also there are people with conditions who are being advised not to have it, so the picture is a little bit hazy at the moment but we are doing all we can.” Ahmed also said that regular testing and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) would likely remain in use even after the vaccine rollout. “We will be having visits into the care services, we will have residents potentially who can’t have the vaccine, so I think PPE remains in place and we will be advising everyone to continue to use PPE,” she said. “I don’t think PPE is something that is just going to disappear once the vaccines have been taken.” Community testing will be rolled out in parts of England on Monday. The government said it was sending out 1m rapid coronavirus tests to areas under tier three restrictions, with 67 local authorities involved in the scheme. Tier 3 is the toughest level of coronavirus restrictions in England, and covers large swaths of the north of England and the Midlands. These tests will be used for greater mass testing to identify cases of the virus. However, there have been some concerns about whether these rapid tests are fit for mass testing. Government figures from the mass testing programme in Liverpool revealed the tests missed 30% of those with a high viral load, and detected only five out of ten positive cases that the standard coronavirus tests picked up. Here is a list of the 67 local authorities involved in the scheme: :: Amber Valley :: Bolsover :: Chesterfield :: Derbyshire Dales :: North East Derbyshire :: South Derbyshire :: Darlington :: Stockton-on-Tees :: Ashford :: Canterbury :: Dartford :: Dover :: Folkestone and Hythe :: Gravesham :: Maidstone :: Sevenoaks :: Swale :: Thanet :: Tonbridge and Malling :: Tunbridge Wells :: Medway :: Blackburn with Darwen :: Blackpool :: Burnley :: Chorley :: Fylde :: Hyndburn :: Lancaster :: Pendle :: Preston :: Ribble Valley :: Rossendale :: South Ribble :: West Lancashire :: Wyre :: Bolton :: Bury :: Manchester :: Oldham :: Rochdale :: Salford :: Stockport :: Tameside :: Trafford :: Wigan :: Barnsley :: Bradford :: Kirklees :: Birmingham :: Dudley :: Sandwell :: Cannock Chase :: East Staffordshire :: Lichfield :: Newcastle-under-Lyme :: South Staffordshire :: Stafford :: Staffordshire Moorlands :: Tamworth :: Stoke-on-Trent :: North Warwickshire :: Nuneaton and Bedworth :: Rugby :: Stratford-on-Avon :: Warwick :: Wolverhampton :: Solihull The government said that while the scheme was limited to England, it would be supporting devolved administrations to “roll out similar exercises”, with a pilot already ongoing in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. The government also said that the administrations will also receive their population share of testing capacity, including lateral flow testing. Russia has reported 560 new coronavirus deaths, taking the country’s official death toll to 46,453. The country also confirmed 28,137 new cases, 6,622 of these in Moscow, bringing the national tally to 2,625,848 since the pandemic began. Hi everyone, I’m Molly Blackall, I’m taking over the live blog for the next few hours. I hope you’re all safe and well. If you spot something we should be reporting on in this blog, you can drop me a message on Twitter. Thanks in advance! I’ll be handing over the blog now to my colleagues in the UK. Thanks for reading, and thanks to Michael McGowan for running the blog earlier. Stay tuned for the latest news across the UK and Europe. Here’s what has happened over the past few hours: The US president, Donald Trump, said the first US citizens will receive a Covid-19 vaccine in “less than 24 hours” after the country gave emergency approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Mexico also approved emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, a day after it recorded 12,253 new cases of coronavirus and 693 additional deaths. Australia’s acting chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, said Australia will not rush through the Pfizer vaccine and it “will be going through the full regulatory process”. The country has already ordered doses of the Pfizer vaccine, but also has a deal for millions of doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, said the country was in “an emergency situation”, after its highest day of new case numbers. The country reported 950 new cases, the highest daily count since the peak of 909 reported on 29 February. Peru temporarily suspended clinical trials of the Chinese Covid vaccine after detecting neurological problems in one of its test volunteers. That vaccine is made by drug giant Sinopharm. Germany recorded 28,438 new cases and 496 new deaths. New Zealand announced it would create a quarantine-free travel bubble with Cook Islands in the first quarter of 2021. Brazil’s health ministry is studying 58 suspected cases of Covid-19 reinfection after confirming the first case of a person getting reinfected with coronavirus, a ministry spokeswoman said. The first case was a health worker in the northern city of Natal, a 37-year-old woman who tested positive in June and again 116 days later in October, the ministry said. Indoor dining restrictions will be reinstated indefinitely in New York City, governor Andrew Cuomo has announced as coronavirus cases and hospitalisations continue climbing in the city and throughout the state. A firebrand cleric in Indonesia has turned himself in to authorities after he was accused of inciting people to breach pandemic restrictions by holding events with large crowds. Rizieq Shihab, leader of the Islamic Defenders Front, arrived at Jakarta police headquarters a day after police warned they would arrest him after he ignored several summonses. Wearing a white robe, turban and face mask, Shihab told reporters that he never ran away or hid from police, Reuters reports. “With God’s permission, I can come to the Jakarta police for an investigation according to the laws and regulations,” he said ahead of questioning. Jakarta police spokesman Yusri Yunus told a news conference on Friday that Shihab is accused of ignoring measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 by holding an event to commemorate Prophet Muhammad’s birthday and the wedding of his daughter last month that pulled in thousands of his supporters. He said Shihab could face up to six years in prison if found guilty of inciting people to violate health regulations amid an outbreak and of obstructing law enforcement. Shihab’s presence in several events in Jakarta and West Java attracted large crowds with attendants visibly ignoring physical distancing and many failing to wear masks. Jakarta’s governor, Anies Baswedan, and West Java’s governor, Ridwan Kamil, have been questioned as witnesses in the case. The gatherings took place less than a week after his arrival from a three-year exile in Saudi Arabia. Today the Guardian is launching “The lost year” – a special supplement about the past 12 months and how it has changed during the pandemic. The first piece is from Jonathan Freedland who says the best metaphor for the year isn’t a face mask, or an elbow bump, but is the magnifying glass. Peru has temporarily suspended clinical trials of a Covid vaccine made by Chinese drug giant Sinopharm after detecting neurological problems in one of its test volunteers, Agence France-Presse reports. The country’s National Institute of Health said Friday that it had decided to interrupt the trial after a volunteer had difficulty moving their arms, according to local media. “Several days ago we signalled, as we are required, to the regulatory authorities that one of our participants (in trials) presented neurological symptoms which could correspond to a condition called Guillain-Barre syndrome,” said the chief researcher, German Malaga, in comments to the press. Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare and non-contagious disorder which affects the movement of the arms and legs. Peru declared a temporary health emergency in five regions in June last year following multiple cases. In the 1970s a campaign to innoculate Americans against a supposedly devastating strain of swine flu ground to a halt after some 450 of those vaccinated developed the syndrome, which can also cause paralysis. Peru’s clinical trials for the Sinopharm vaccine were due to conclude this week, after testing around 12,000 people. If they are successful – which won’t be known until mid-2021 – the Peruvian government was expected to buy up to 20m doses to inoculate two-thirds of its population. Some 60,000 people across the globe have already taken the Sinopharm vaccine, including volunteers in Argentina, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Peru has one of the world’s highest per capita death rates from the virus, which as of Friday had caused 36,499 deaths and 979,111 infections. The pandemic has hit the South American country’s economy hard, with GDP plunging more than 30% in the second quarter. A new coronavirus case in northern China, on the border with Russia, has sparked a lockdown, Agence France-Presse reports. China has put the northern city of Dongning in lockdown and launched citywide coronavirus testing in Suifenhe, after two local infections involving workers at a port and trade zone respectively, authorities have said. Both cities recorded a new case, and sit on the border with Russia. In Dongning, a 40-year-old maintenance worker at a port tested positive on Thursday, triggering the latest measures. Officials there said on Saturday it would enter “wartime mode” – temporarily suspending public bus services and road transport, while requiring anyone leaving the city to produce a negative Covid-19 test from the preceding 24 hours. Schools will suspend classes and dine-in will be banned at restaurants, while in higher-risk areas only one member of each household will be allowed to leave the home once every two days to buy daily necessities – for no longer than two hours each time. In the Suifenhe case, a 39-year-old man who works as a loading and unloading worker at a trade zone tested positive. Both cities on Friday announced the launch of citywide testing, expected to be completed in three days. State media blamed the recent clusters on imports of frozen food and other shipments. After a recent outbreak in Chengdu, officials said the virus was found on food stored in an elderly couple’s fridge. There is currently no evidence that people can catch Covid-19 from food or food packaging, according to the World Health Organization. Police have clashed with climate protesters in Melbourne, as they glued and chained themselves to each other and the pavement before being arrested by officers carrying bolt-cutters. South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, has described today’s new coronavirus cases as “an emergency situation”. Earlier, we reported that the country logged 950 new cases, the highest daily count since the peak of 909 cases reported on 29 February. “This is indeed an emergency situation,” Moon said. “We plan to extensively expand drive-through and walk-through coronavirus testing methods ... as preemptive measures to track down infected people and block the spread.” South Korea is likely to see a further rise in the caseload with significant increases in testing, he added. He has now ordered the mobilisation of police, military personnel and public medical doctors in an effort to curb the further spread of the coronavirus, according to Reuters. Germany has recorded 28,438 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, taking the total in the country to 1,300,516, according to the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases. An additional 496 people died from the virus, taking the total death toll to 21,466. In Australia, parts of New South Wales and Queensland are on flood watch as heavy rains continue. Overnight, Coffs Harbour received 180mm in less than 24 hours and Bowraville got 195mm. In Queensland, more than 200mm of rain is forecast for Brisbane and the Gold and Sunshine coasts from Saturday. Hi everyone, it is Naaman Zhou here on the blog. Thanks to my colleague Michael McGowan for all his work today. Australia’s acting chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, has just been on the ABC and said Australia will not rush through the Pfizer vaccine that has been given emergency approval in the US and UK. Earlier today, the US president, Donald Trump, announced the emergency approval and said the first US citizens would be vaccinated in 24 hours. Kelly said that Australia had ordered the Pfizer vaccine, but “we will be going through the full regulatory process”. Australia also has millions of doses of the Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine to be rolled out in March. Kelly said: [It is] quite a different situation in the UK, in Canada and now in the United States in terms of what is happening with the pandemic and their need ... But to just stress, this is not full approval that the FDA has given and neither has the UK, neither has Canada. These are emergency authorisations to allow the vaccine to roll out. Also overnight, and this is part of the reason why the FDA is confident to give that authorisation, in the New England Journal of Medicine, one of the premier medical journals in the world, Pfizer has reported on their phase three trial results, their interim results, and it is very encouraging. We have heard some of the headlines before, but there is now more detail and it is peer-reviewed scientific literature, and that is how to move forward, with scientific expertise. Ninety-five per cent effective, effective in old and young people, effective in healthy and people with chronic disease and a very good safety profile. These are interim results and we will get more detail and much more detail will come to the Therapeutic Goods Administration to allow them to make their own independent assessment of these matters and give us regulatory approval and confidence that we absolutely need for any new vaccine, that it is safe and effective. That is where I will leave you for today. I’ll hand you over to my colleague Naaman Zhou who will be with you for the next few hours. An emergency-room doctor whose dedication throughout the coronavirus pandemic garnered praise from Joe Biden has claimed he was fired by the Arizona hospital where he worked for tweeting about the outbreak’s impact. Healthcare workers and elderly people in long-term care facilities are expected to be the first recipients for vaccine shots in the US, with initial limitations on supplies meaning most of the general public will have to wait months for the vaccines to become widely available. Reuters reports that the Indiana University Health centre, one of the first hospitals designated to administer the vaccine, rehearsed its vaccination procedures on Friday, with pharmacists, nurses and doctors taking part in drills for storing, transporting and giving actual shots to patients. “We want to make sure that we are perfectly ready and open with a bang,” Kristen Kelley, director of infection prevention at IU Health, told Reuters. Elsewhere, however, many healthcare workers were struggling just to keep up with a staggering caseload while facing shortages of staff and personal protective equipment (PPE), including surgical gloves, gowns and rapid diagnostic test kits. “We don’t have nearly enough. They’re not readily available, they take too long, and the supply chain isn’t working consistently,” said Konnie Martin, the chief executive officer for San Luis Valley Health, which runs the Regional Medical Center in Alamosa, Colorado. The Alamosa hospital serves six mostly rural counties in southern Colorado that are home to some 50,000 residents. In Australia, Melbourne’s Flemington racetrack has welcomed back crowds for the first time since March. AAP reports that up to 1,000 guests will attend the Living Legends Race Day on Saturday, the first Flemington race meet since the first crowd-free Melbourne Cup Day on 3 November. It comes after the Victorian government last week granted permission for 500 spectators on Saturday, which they extended on Wednesday to 1,000 people. The Victorian Racing Club said up to 900 members could sit in the club stand, while up to 100 owners were also permitted to attend the meet. All patrons will be allocated a seat and social distancing will be enforced. The entire spring racing carnival in 2020 was held behind closed doors as Victoria slowly emerged from its devastating second coronavirus wave. The FDA’s statement explains the Pfizer vaccine is administered as a series of two doses, three weeks apart. Available safety data to support the emergency approval included 37,586 participants enrolled in an ongoing randomised, placebo-controlled international study. Of those participants, 18,801 received the vaccine and 18,785 received a saline placebo. They were followed for a median of two months after receiving the second dose. The FDA says the most commonly reported side-effects, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. Trials of the vaccine showed it was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 among the participants. There were eight Covid-19 cases in the vaccine group and 162 in the placebo group. One case in the vaccine group was classified as severe. However, the FDA statement also makes clear that “at this time” there is no available data “to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person”. But the director of the FDA’s centre for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Peter Marks, has said the emergency approval “holds the promise to alter the course of this pandemic in the United States”. While not an FDA approval, today’s emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine holds the promise to alter the course of this pandemic in the United States. With science guiding our decision-making, the available safety and effectiveness data support the authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine because the vaccine’s known and potential benefits clearly outweigh its known and potential risks. The data provided by the sponsor have met the FDA’s expectations as conveyed in our June and October guidance documents. Efforts to speed vaccine development have not sacrificed scientific standards or the integrity of our vaccine evaluation process. The US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Stephen Hahn has released a statement also confirming the authorisation of the Pfizer vaccine: The FDA’s authorization for emergency use of the first Covid-19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world. Today’s action follows an open and transparent review process that included input from independent scientific and public health experts and a thorough evaluation by the agency’s career scientists to ensure this vaccine met FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization. The tireless work to develop a new vaccine to prevent this novel, serious, and life-threatening disease in an expedited timeframe after its emergence is a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide. In its statement the FDA said the vaccine “has met the statutory criteria for issuance” of an emergency approval. The FDA said the “totality of the available data provides clear evidence that Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine may be effective in preventing Covid-19”. It states: The data also support that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine’s use in millions of people 16 years of age and older, including healthy individuals. In making this determination, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that it has conducted a thorough evaluation of the available safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality information. The US president, Donald Trump, has released a video confirming the FDA’s approval of the Pfizer vaccine. He begins by saying: “I have really good news.” Trump: Today our nation has achieved a medical miracle. We have delivered a safe and effective vaccine in just nine months. This is one of the greatest scientific accomplishments in history. It will save millions of lives and soon end the pandemic once and for all. I am thrilled to report that the FDA has authorised the Pfizer vaccine. We have given Pfizer and other companies a great deal of money hoping this would be the outcome, and it was. Trump says the government has already begun shipping the vaccine, and that the first person will receive it in “less than 24 hours”. The US Food and Drug Administration has reportedly given emergency approval to a coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, the first drug to prevent Covid-19 approved in the US. It makes the US the sixth country – following Britain, Bahrain, Canada, Saudi Arabia and Mexico – to approve the vaccine. The news was first reported by the New York Times. South Korea reported 950 new coronavirus cases as of Friday midnight, the highest daily count since the peak of 909 cases reported on 29 February, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said on Saturday. Reuters reports that of the new cases, 928 were locally transmitted and 22 were imported, which bring the total tally to 41,736 infections, with 578 deaths. More than 70% the domestically transmitted cases were from Seoul and its neighbouring areas. Despite tougher social distancing rules that took effect on Tuesday, including unprecedented curfews on restaurants and most other businesses, South Korea is suffering a third wave of coronavirus outbreaks. The new cases have been consistently around 600 over the past week. The surge has been a blow to South Korea’s vaunted pandemic-fighting system, which successfully used invasive tracing, testing and quarantine to avoid lockdowns and blunt previous waves, and keep infections below 50 a day for much of the summer. Calling the current wave a critical crisis, the prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, said on Friday he would dispatch around 800 military, police and government workers in every district of the greater Seoul area to help track down potential patients. New Zealand and the Cook Islands have agreed to a travel arrangement, the leaders of the two countries have announced. New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and her Cook Islands counterpart, Mark Brown, instructed officials to put in place measures to safely recommence two-way quarantine-free travel in the first quarter of 2021. Queensland’s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, says the first “quarantine-free” flight to arrive in Queensland from New Zealand is not due until Wednesday. In a statement on Saturday, Young said although Queensland’s border with NZ will lift from today, the state had implemented national protocols to split flights between people “who have only been in safe travel zone countries, versus those who have also been in other countries”. “Anyone who travels to Queensland from New Zealand on a quarantine-free flight – where every passenger has only been in New Zealand in the past 14 days – will not be required to quarantine on arrival,” Young said. “Anyone who doesn’t travel on a quarantine-free flight is still subject to 14 days mandatory quarantine. We have a New Zealand flight arriving in Brisbane today that isn’t a quarantine-free flight, which means those people will need to complete quarantine.” Young said the department is working with hospital and health services across the state to determine which travellers from New Zealand currently in hotel quarantine can leave quarantine today. “Our staff are working quickly on the ground to determine those who arrived in Queensland on a quarantine-free flight, so we can let them out of quarantine, provided they return a negative Covid-19 test,” she said. Mexico’s health regulator Cofepris has approved the emergency use of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine, the deputy health minister, Hugo Lopez-Gatell, said on Friday. Mexico has registered 12,253 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and 693 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 1,229,379 cases and 113,019 deaths. While many countries saw supermarkets stripped bare of toilet paper at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, AFP reports that in Albania it is donkey milk that has seen a rise in demand. Touted as rich in vitamins and a boost for the immune system, the high-priced milk has been flying off the shelves during the coronavirus pandemic – a time when many in Albania are looking for an extra health kick. “The demand for donkey milk is rising sharply” alongside virus infections, says 37-year-old Elton Kikia, the manager of the small farm in the village of Paper, where around a dozen of the small, knobbly-kneed animals romp around a green pasture. The high demand is good news for the donkeys themselves, whose comfortable lifestyle on the farm is a welcome respite from their traditional roles as beasts of burden. Typically enlisted to carry heavy loads and pull carts through Albania’s mountainous terrain, donkeys are frequently subject to mistreatment, in the form of beatings, overwork or saddle sores. “Yet it is a very delicate animal, which to produce its milk needs tenderness and love,” Kikia told AFP. Two years ago he left his job as a journalist to take over the family farm, which is only one of two in the country to raise donkeys for their milk. At 50 euros a litre, the price of their milk is exorbitant in a country where the average wage barely reaches 400 euros a month. But fears around Covid-19 have set off a flurry of interest. While no one is branding the milk as a cure for the virus, aficionados are convinced its nutritional profile – which is close to human milk – helps strengthen the body’s natural defences. Klea Ymeri, a student in agro-environmental engineering, recently travelled to Paper to buy two 250ml bottles to help her parents recover from Covid-19. “On top of the medicines they are taking, donkey’s milk could be a good natural remedy for the respiratory system”, she told AFP. After Victoria recorded its first cases of Covid-19 in its new hotel quarantine system, the state’s chief medical officer, Brett Sutton, has assured the state’s residents the results were “expected”. “All arrivals are tested if they show symptoms, as well as at Day 3 and Day 11 of their 14-day quarantine,” he said in a statement. “Evidence from our earlier hotel quarantine program showed that just over one in every 100 returned travellers tested positive during their quarantine period. “The likelihood of a positive case will vary depending on which country someone has arrived from, but we would expect to see at least a similar rate of positive cases being diagnosed in the coming weeks.” Victoria resumed its hotel quarantine operations on 7 December. It previously began on 29 March and ended after Victoria requested the federal government suspend international flights to Melbourne on 30 June. During that period 21,821 travellers were processed and 236 tested positive. Hi, my name is Michael McGowan. For the next little while I’m your guide through the latest coronavirus news from around the world. In Australia, hopes for a Covid-19 vaccine are increasingly being pinned on the British-developed AstraZeneca-Oxford University candidate, after the Australian-led Covid-19 vaccine in development by the University of Queensland and pharmaceutical company CSL was abandoned after some participants in early trials returned false-positive HIV tests. Australia responded by increasing its stake in the AstraZeneca vaccine to 53.8m, enough to cover the country’s entire population. It came as Victoria recorded its first cases of Covid-19 inside the state’s relaunched hotel quarantine system on Saturday. Five people – two men and three women – tested positive for the virus, but health authorities say they are confident the revamped quarantine system will not suffer the same breaches that led to the deadly second-wave outbreak. At the same time, the US government exercised its option to buy an additional 100m doses of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate, bringing its confirmed order commitment to 200m doses. In a statement to investors, Moderna said about 20m doses of the vaccine would be delivered “by the end of December 2020”. The remaining 80m would be delivered in the first quarter of 2021, while the additional 100m announced today would come in the second quarter of 2021. In other developments: The World Health Organization warned that Christmas celebrations could turn to “sadness” if people fail to keep up their guard against Covid-19 during the festive season. The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the number of deaths in the coronavirus pandemic was surging and urged people to think very carefully about holiday season plans. Brazil’s health ministry is studying 58 suspected cases of Covid-19 reinfection after confirming the first case of a person getting reinfected with coronavirus, a ministry spokeswoman said. The first case was a health worker in the northern city of Natal, a 37-year-old woman who tested positive in June and again 116 days later in October, the ministry said on Thursday. Indoor dining restrictions will be reinstated indefinitely in New York City, governor Andrew Cuomo has announced as coronavirus cases and hospitalisations continue climbing in the city and throughout the state. The UK reported 424 new Covid-related deaths on Friday, as the number of coronavirus patients admitted to hospital increased week on week. Portugal reported 95 deaths linked to Covid-19 on Friday, its worst daily toll since the pandemic started. Switzerland has ordered restaurants, bars and shops to close down from 7pm across much of the nation, the government said on Friday, as the country continues to face a persistently high level of Covid-19 infections and deaths.",

      "bodyText": "Newcastle 1-0 West Brom The in-form Conor Gallagher has missed an excellent chance to equalise, sidefooting a loose ball just wide from 12 yards. Stuttgart lead again in Dortmund! Silas Wamangituka has got his second goal, and Kári Tulinius will be along any second now to tell us whether it was any good. In Scotland, Hibernian have gone 2-0 up at Hamilton. That means Celtic will probably drop to third tonight, though they have three games in hand on Hibs. Newcastle 1-0 West Brom Sam Johnstone makes a good save from Joelinton, who twisted Ivanovic inside out in the penalty area. Joelinton looks so much more confident now. The latest scores in our featured games Premier League Wolves 0-1 Aston Villa (FT) Newcastle 1-0 West Brom Championship Cardiff 0-2 Swansea (FT) Blackburn 0-1 Norwich Bournemouth 3-0 Huddersfield Bundesliga Borussia Dortmund 1-1 VfB Stuttgart (2.30pm) RB Leipzig 2-0 Werder Bremen (2.30pm) Here’s Niall Mullen “Since Dortmund’s recruitment model is based largely on picking up the insanely talented sons of average 90s Premier League players, who will be next on their radar? David Hopkin’s son? Jonathan Greening’s? Steve Harkness’s? I can’t wait to find out.” The pedant in me is screaming is that Claudio Reyna didn’t come to the Premier League until 2001. This is what I have to live with. It’s half-time in the Bundesliga. Leipzig lead Bremen 2-0, Dortmund are drawing 1-1 with Stuttgart. The other games are all goalless. Newcastle 1-0 West Brom Almiron’s goal was officially timed at 19.98 seconds, which is coincidentally my fastest 20 0 m time. Newcastle 1-0 West Brom Newcastle have the game under control. West Brom are having a lot of the ball but haven’t created anything of note. “It seems the missing ingredient in Solanke’s career at his previous club was for Liverpool to have been relegated,” sniffs Ian Copestake. The leaders are ahead at Ewood Park. Teemu Pukki got the goal with a smart shot on the turn from Alex Tettey’s low cross. David Brooks made Bournemouth’s first goal; now he’s scored their third with a sweet curling shot from 20 yards. He’s 18 years old “Hello Rob,” says Kári Tulinius. “A team doesn’t need to play well when it has great players. Gio Reyna just scored a Bergkampesque goal, cushioning Reus’s pass from the halfway line with his first touch before chipping over Koble in goal with the outside of his right foot.” SO WHY AM I WATCHING NEWCASTLE v WEST BROM. Wolves 0-1 Aston Villa Here’s more on that win for Villa at Molineux. Bournemouth are cruising. Jefferson Lerma wins the ball on the edge of the area and finds Dominic Solanke, who rams a low shot into the far corner for his second goal ofthe game. Leipzig are having another good day at the office. Dani Olmo has put them 2-0 ahead, and as things stand they are top of the table. Dortmund veteran Gio Reyna, 18, has brought them level from Marco Reus’s pass. An early goal for promotion-chasing Bournemouth. David Brooks slides in Dominic Solanke, who draws the keeper and dinks the ball confidently into the net. It was a really nice pass from Brooks, who is far too good for that division. “Hi Rob,” says Niall Mullen. “Hope you’re well this fine, fine December day. I see he’s starting for Millwall but is there any chance that Troy Parrott will be good? Since Robbie Keane’s debut for Ireland I’ve forlornly pinned my ‘new Robbie Keane’ hopes on (deep breath): Clinton Morrison, Kevin Doyle, Stephen Elliott, Shane Long, Leon Best, Anthony Stokes, Michael Obafemi, Adam Idah, Aaron Connolly and many more. Sadly, it feels like the Troy hype may have outstripped his ability. Which, apart from everything else, massively the chances of anyone using the headline ‘C’est Troy bien’.” He’s going to score the winning penalty for Jose in the Champions League final. You heard it here last. These are the latest scores in our featured games Premier League Wolves 0-1 Aston Villa (FT) Newcastle 1-0 West Brom Championship Cardiff 0-2 Swansea (FT) Blackburn 0-0 Norwich Bournemouth 0-0 Huddersfield Bundesliga Borussia Dortmund 0-1 VfB Stuttgart (2.30pm) RB Leipzig 1-0 Werder Bremen (2.30pm) “Hello Rob,” says Kári Tulinius. “I may be biased as a Stuttgart fan, but VfB have much better than Dortmund. This season is the best Stuttgart have been in probably at least a decade. Pellegrino Matarazzo, Stuttgart’s American coach, has done an excellent job with this team. Even by the high standards of the Bundesliga, their pressing is top-notch.” I’m now trying to follow the Newcastle game but I agree that Stuttgart were the better team in the first 20 minutes. They could have scored two or three times before they went ahead. “Afternoon Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Today’s big game in Scotland is, eh, tomorrow when Dundee United welcome runaway league leaders and future Kings of Europe Rangers to Tannadice hoping to derail the champions-elect bandwagon. I’m not holding my breath, mind, given that, after 16 games, United have scored 12 and conceded 20, while Rangers have scored 45 and conceded just 3. “Hibs can go above crisis club Celtic with a win at Hamilton, and Aberdeen would draw level with Neil Lennon’s beleaguered Hoops should they beat Ross County. The other SPFL games are Motherwell v St. Mirren and St. Johnstone v Livingston. In the Scottish Championship, leaders Hearts are at home to Queen of the South, while struggling Dundee are at Inverness.” Newcastle 1-0 West Brom Branislav Ivanovic thought he was fouled by Callum Wilson in the build up to that goal. I’d like to see that again. I don’t think the shoulder charge was a foul, but he may have accidentally scraped his studs down Ivanovic’s calf. Miguel Almiron scores after 20 seconds! Callum Wilson bumped Ivanovic off the ball on the left and found Joelinton. He poked the ball through to Miguel Almiron, who opened his body to sweep the ball past Sam Johnstone. That was a really confident finish. Peep peep! The 3pm games are underway. A penalty at Leipzig as well. Marcel Sabitzer has scored it to put the home side in front. A win would put them top of the table, if only for a few hours. Dortmund are behind at home again. Silas Wamangituka scored confidently from the spot after Emre Can was penalised for a desperate tackle on Mateo Klimowicz. Dortmund 0-0 Stuttgart Jude Bellingham has had a goal disallowed for offside against Marco Reus in the build-up. Bournemouth (4-3-3) Begovic; Smith, Simpson, S Cook, Kelly; L Cook, Lerma, Billing; Brooks, Solanke, Stanislas. Huddersfield (4-2-3-1) Hamer; Rowe, Edmonds-Green, Sarr, Toffolo; Pritchard, O’Brien, Bacuna; Diakhaby, Ward, Brown. Villa leapfrog Wolves with another fine away win. It all went wrong in injury-time for Wolves: Nelson Semedo gave away a stupid penalty, scored by Anwar El-Ghazi, and then Joao Moutinho was sent off. A fine win for Swansea in the South Wales derby. Jamal Lowe scored both goals, the second a swaggering masterpiece, to see off ten-man Cardiff. Anwar El Ghazi scores emphatically from the spot to give ten-man Villa a superb victory at Wolves. There’s an injury-time penalty at Molineux! Blackburn (4-3-3) Kaminski; Nyambe, Lenihan, Williams, Douglas; Holtby, Johnson, Rothwell; Gallagher, Armstrong, Elliott. Norwich (4-2-3-1) McGovern; Aarons, Hanley, Zimmermann, Sorensen; Tettey, Skipp; Buendia, Vrancic, Martin; Pukki. Wolves 0-0 Aston Villa No goals but there has been a red card at Molineux. Barry Glendenning will reveal all. Leipzig (3-4-2-1) Gulacsi; Mukiele, Upamecano, Orban; Haidara, Sabitzer, Kampl, Halstenberg; Olmo, Kluivert; Poulsen. Bremen (4-2-3-1) Pavlenka; Gebre Selassie, Toprak, Friedl, Augustinsson; Eggestein, Gross; Bittencourt, Mohwald, Schmid; Sargent. Dortmund (3-4-3) Burki; Can, Hummels, Akanji; Morey Bauza, Bellingham, Witsel, Guerreiro; Sancho, Reus, Reyna. Stuttgart (3-5-2) Koble; Mavropanos, Anton, Kempf; Wamangituka, Forster, Endo, Mangal, Sosa; Klimowicz, Coulibaly. Newcastle are without a number of defenders, including Federico Fernandez, Fabian Schar and Javier Manquillo. It looks like Isaac Hayden will play as a makeshift centre-half. That aside, it’s close to a full-strength team. Newcastle (4-4-2) Darlow; Krafth, Hayden, Clark, Lewis; Almiron, Shelvey, S Longstaff, Ritchie; Wilson, Joelinton. Substitutes: Langley, Yedlin, Hendrick, Murphy, M Longstaff, Carroll, Gayle. West Brom (3-5-2) Johnstone; Ajayi, Ivanovic, O’Shea; Furlong, Gallagher, Krovinovic, Sawyers, Phillips; Grant, Robinson. Substitutes: Button, Gibbs, Kipre, Livermore, Diangana, Grosicki, Austin. Jamal Lowe’s second goal, a spectacular individual effort, has surely sealed victory for Swansea in the South Wales derby. That was some goal: he swaggered past three defenders, reached the edge of the area and flicked the ball nonchalantly into the net with the outside of his right foot. It’s Wolves 0-0 Aston Villa in the early Premier League game. Barry Glendenning is trying to stay awake for the last 20 minutes. Hello and welcome to another busy Saturday afternoon clockwatch. Our lead game is Newcastle’s return to action after a Covid outbreak at St James’ Park. They are at home to West Brom, and we’ll find out shortly what kind of team Steve Bruce is able to put out. There’s also plenty going on in the Championship, including the South Wales derby at the Cardiff City Stadium. With 20 minutes remaining, Swansea are a goal and a man up: Jamal Lowe scored early on, Joe Ralls has just been sent off. We’ll be keeping an eye on the Bundesliga as well, with RB Leipzig and Borussia Dortmund in action. These are our featured games, all 3pm kick-offs unless stated. Premier League Wolves 0-0 Aston Villa (12.30pm) Newcastle v West Brom Championship Cardiff 0-0 Swansea (12.30pm) Blackburn v Norwich Bournemouth v Huddersfield Bundesliga Borussia Dortmund v VfB Stuttgart (2.30pm) RB Leipzig v Werder Bremen (2.30pm)",

      "bodyText": "Senior Conservatives have criticised Boris Johnson’s handling of the Brexit trade negotiations and his threat to deploy Royal Navy gunboats to patrol UK fishing waters in the event of no deal. With the Sunday deadline for reaching an agreement fast approaching, the Ministry of Defence confirmed four 80-metre armed vessels had been placed on standby to guard British waters from EU trawlers from 1 January, in the absence of an agreement on fishing rights. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee, called the threat of deploying gunboats “irresponsible”, when attention should be focused on striking a deal, while the former EU commissioner Chris Patten accused the prime minister of behaving like an “English nationalist”. Johnson said on Friday that fishing rights were one of the two major impediments to a deal, the other being how to maintain fair competition once the UK is able to set its own standards and regulations from the end of the transition period in three weeks’ time. The readying of the navy vessels is likely to be interpreted as a warning to Brussels over the consequences of no deal being agreed on trade – an outcome both sides have said is now the likeliest outcome. Ellwood, a former defence minister, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think these headlines are absolutely irresponsible. We need to be focusing on what is already in the bag – 98% of the deal is there, there are three or four outstanding issues. “Important though they are, let’s park those for the future. Let’s get this deal because economically, but most importantly, international reputationally this would be so damaging to Britain – it would be a retrograde step, a failure of statecraft.” Patten, also speaking to Today, accused Johnson of being on a “runaway train of English exceptionalism”.

I’ve been watching the history of Chicago drill music, simply because there are a lot of rappers losing their lives to gun violence and I find it so interesting to learn about what is going wrong. It’s historical. Gang violence is so deep-rooted that we can’t start unravelling this today, but it’s artists I like and that I’m listening to who are dying, and it hurts. One, King Von, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/06/king-von-rapper-shot-dead-atlanta-shooting\">lost his life last month</a>. He was an up-and-coming rapper.</p> <h2>5.

It’s his style. The first time I saw his work, it just took me back. I was one of those kids who sat down in front of the TV and watched cartoons right before school and right after school. Ben Jennings’s colours invite me in. They’re really funny and quirky. His stuff is so political, but you always get the message. It’s just another form of comedy, but it’s real stuff you’re being served on the plate. When I look at them, I come away with so many things.</p> <h2>6.

      "bodyText": "Flohio was born Funmi Ohiosumah in Nigeria in 1992 and raised in Bermondsey, south London. The rapper first featured on God Colony’s track SE16 in 2016 and in 2018 released her first EP Wild Yout, which merged UK hip-hop with grime. She was chosen for BBC Music’s Sound of 2019 list and her 10-track debut mixtape, No Panic No Pain, was released last month to critical acclaim. 1. Film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse Different spider people from different universes come together to help defeat a monster. It has the first black spider-boy, Miles, who is the protagonist, and also a spider-woman. I’ve watched it about three times now, once with my nephew. I sat him down and said: “Put your iPad down, you’re watching this with me!” Watching movies growing up, with my dad or my sister, it was such a thing to be immersed in whatever it is that’s on and just put yourself in that character’s shoes. 2. Music Cruel Santino He’s a Nigerian artist who meshes soul with Afrobeats. What I really like about him is that when you hear about something that’s come out of Africa, you kind of have an idea of what it’s going to be, but he pushes the boundaries. He paints with his words. Even with his visuals, he incorporates Nollywood. He’s in his own lane. I like Rapid Fire from his album Mandy &amp; the Jungle. I like how it starts off slow and picks up pace towards the end. It just keeps you on your feet. It’s so smooth, you want to sing to it. 3. Video game Mortal Kombat 11 I’m so into video games. I have a PS4 console but I’m trying to get the PS5! Back in the day, if I wanted to play video games, it would be at a friend’s house, but eventually, when I got my own console, the first game I got was Mortal Kombat. I love Mortal Kombat 11, simply because I like every single character’s way of fighting. It’s along the lines of Tekken. The great thing is that technology has gotten better. The graphics, the sound, it’s a whole different experience now. 4. YouTube Chicago drill music documentaries YouTube is a wormhole – you go in and you get lost. I’ve been watching the history of Chicago drill music, simply because there are a lot of rappers losing their lives to gun violence and I find it so interesting to learn about what is going wrong. It’s historical. Gang violence is so deep-rooted that we can’t start unravelling this today, but it’s artists I like and that I’m listening to who are dying, and it hurts. One, King Von, lost his life last month. He was an up-and-coming rapper. 5. Art Ben Jennings He’s so fire! It’s his style. The first time I saw his work, it just took me back. I was one of those kids who sat down in front of the TV and watched cartoons right before school and right after school. Ben Jennings’s colours invite me in. They’re really funny and quirky. His stuff is so political, but you always get the message. It’s just another form of comedy, but it’s real stuff you’re being served on the plate. When I look at them, I come away with so many things. 6. Food Shumai I don’t care where I am in the world, I will look for something Asian before I try the local food. Before the second lockdown, I tried to hit up some restaurants in Soho. Taro has a nice vibe, when I’m feeling low-key. You watch them cook the food. When I’m feeling bougie, I go to Yauatcha. My favourite thing to order are these little Japanese starters called shumai. I don’t even know how to describe them, but they are a scallop wrapped in a prawn with roe on top. They are so nice. I need to learn how to make them.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump is not only provoking fury among opponents in his race to complete a spate of federal executions in his last weeks in office. He is also rushing in the opposite direction from states across the US, which are increasingly rejecting the death penalty – as is the American public. While a majority of US states maintain the death penalty, and a majority of the public still supports it, the numbers of prisoners being killed and the amount of public support for executions continues to shrink, while the numbers of states giving up the penalty is increasing, fast. Ngozi Ndulue, senior director of research and special projects at the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), in Washington, DC, described the Trump administration’s hasty series of executions since the summer “a spree” that is “breathtaking”. “The federal government has shown itself to be out of step with the states and out of step with history,” she told the Guardian. More Americans now oppose the death penalty than at any point in more than half a century, according to a Gallup survey published last month. A majority of Americans still favor executions for criminals convicted of murder, but the share, 55%, is at its lowest point since 1972, when 50% said they supported the practice. But the president and his attorney general, Bill Barr, revived federal executions last summer, after they had basically been on hold for 17 years, and are now rushing prisoners to the execution chamber. “We have to bring back the death penalty. They have to pay the ultimate price. They can’t do this. They can’t do this to our country,” Donald Trump has said. Five executions were scheduled between last Thursday and Trump leaving the White House on 20 January, making a total of 13 federal executions since July and cementing Trump’s legacy as the most prolific execution president in over 130 years. On Friday, the Trump administration put to death the second man in two days. “I think the way to stop the death penalty is to repeal the death penalty,” Barr said. “But if you ask juries to impose and juries impose it, then it should be carried out.” In the past 10 years, 10 states have either abolished the death penalty or declared a moratorium on executions. “The death penalty cannot be, and never has been, administered equitably in the state of Colorado,” Governor Jared Polis said after outlawing capital punishment in the state in March. Colorado’s move followed similar action in New Hampshire in 2019, Washington state in 2018 and, also since 2010, Delaware, Maryland, Connecticut and Illinois, while governors in California, Pennsylvania and Oregon declared a moratorium on executions, in a rush of action that means a total of 22 states and the District of Columbia now eschew the death penalty. Next year, the Virginia legislature will consider legislation to repeal it there. It that passes, it would mark a dramatic transformation for Virginia, which would advance from what the Washington Post called the state’s “dubious honor of being the first and most lethal executioner in the nation”. It recorded an official execution by gunshot for treason in the Jamestown Colony in 1608 and since then has officially put to death more of its citizens than states such as Texas, Oklahoma and Florida that have been much more prolific executioners in the modern era. Meanwhile, states that have the death penalty are using it less. Texas, which has been the overwhelming modern powerhouse of US executions, put to death three prisoners this year. At its peak the state executed 40 people in 2000. In its 2019 annual report the DPIC said 22 prisoners were killed by just seven states that year – a dramatic decline from the peak of 98 executions in 1999 and the lowest number since 20 were put to death three years before. She pointed out that there were three federal executions between 1988 and 2019, a period covering both Republican and Democratic administrations. “There is no precedent in the 20th or the 21st centuries” for either the volume of federal executions this year or the persistence in a transition period from one president to another, Ndulue said. And of the 25 states that maintain capital punishment, Ndulue said that “less than 2% of jurisdictions are responsible for more than half of the death sentences and executions” in the modern era. About a dozen states that issue the death penalty haven’t executed anyone in at least a decade. There are many factors encouraging states to leave capital punishment to the past. States that have abolished the death penalty in the 21st century have not seen a corresponding rise in murders. And over the length of a case, capital punishment is more expensive, in dollars, than life imprisonment. The federal death penalty has also long been used disproportionately against people of color. Murders where the victim was white are vastly more likely to involve execution, according to the DPIC. “The way that the death penalty is allocated in the US is inextricable from our legacy of racial injustice,” Ndulue said. And the risks of putting the innocent to death are acute. The DPIC cites exonerations that have happened to people even after decades on death row. In recent years, botched lethal injections in several places and fierce rows about the ethics of supplying the chemicals used in the cocktails for such executions, and shortages of the chemicals, have helped to erode public support. Finally, the spate of federal executions in 2020, which brings gatherings of officials, families, lawyers and media, has already increased the spread of coronavirus. And four of the five people on the execution list in December and January are Black Americans in a year of national protest over systemic racism. Ndulue called it an “execution at all costs” strategy by Trump that she found, in a word, “astounding”.",

Douglas Luiz and Joao Moutinho got two each, followed by reds and will have to sit out one-match suspensions. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5fd4d37b8f08b0a99da93ee4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-12-12T14:29:31.100Z\">2.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: Wolves 0-1 Aston Villa</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Peep!

      "bodyText": "Paul Doyle was at Molineux to see Aston Villa snatch the points with a late penalty from Anwar El Ghazi. Read on ... “It’s always disappointing to lose in the end like that, especially in a game where we played good,” he tells BT Sport. On Villa’s penalty: “I didn’t see the images yet but the referee judged and VAR saw it, so keep on going,” he says. “It was a very tense game with a lot of fouls but I think we controlled it in the second half. We created a lot of good, clear chances and we will try to keep on growing on this aspect. Being more clinical is something that we need.” Premier League table: Aston Villa move into the top ten, going into eighth place, level on points with Manchester City but ahead of them on goal difference. Wolves drop out of the top 10 into 11th, level on points with Everton but behind them on goal difference having played one game more. View the Premier League table “This is a great result to come here to Wolves and keep a clean sheet and get the win,” says the Aston Villa manager in an interview with BT Sport. “I thought it was a really tight game and I thought we started both halves better. We never really created big chances. When they countered and had their spells of pressure, we were indebted to our goalkeeper. It was a really good away performance from the whole team.” Post-match reflection: Villa take the points with what I think was their only shot on target in a game that featured 11 yellow cards and two reds. It was a late sickener for Wolves, who forced Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez into several decent saves and were left cursing their luck when Fabio Silva leathered a second-half effort off the foot of the post. While Mike Dean was dishing out cards like an Atlantic City croupier, the game wasn’t particularly bad-tempered or dirty. Mostly of the cautions he issued were for niggly, professional fouls, the sheer volume of which severely diminished the game as a spectacle. Douglas Luiz and Joao Moutinho got two each, followed by reds and will have to sit out one-match suspensions. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It’s all over at Molineux, where Aston Villa have snatched three points they scarcely deserved with a late, late penalty. 90+7 min: Villa substitution: Marvellous Nakamba replaces Jacob Ramsey, who won’t forget his Premier League debut for his hometown club in a hurry. Already on a yellow card, the Wolves midfielder gets another one for a foul on Jacob Ramsey. He protests his innocence but to no avail. Off he pops, to borrow a phrase from referee Mike Dean. 90+5 min: Down to men for the knockings of this match, Aston Villa look to have taken all three points with a smash-and-grab. Ten-man Villa snatch it at the death, Anwar El Ghazi firing low and hard into the bottom right hand corner from the spot. John McGinn cuts inside the penalty area from the left, getting the better of Nelson Semedo. The Wolves defender brings him down! 90+1 min: Mike Dean stands to one side, shrugging his shoulders and refusing to intervene as there’s minor handbags between a few players fromn either side following a Mings challenge on Podence. 88 min: Jack Grealish becomes the sixth Villa player to go in the book for a tackle from behind on Podence. Mike Dean has shown 10 yellow cards this afternoon, with two of them (and the ensuing red) being brandished in the direction of Douglas Luiz. It hasn’t been a particularly dirty game but there has been a lot of what is technically known in the trade as “niggle”. 86 min: Jack Grealish comes perilously close to conceding a penalty, grabbing a handful of Adama Traore’s shirt as the Wolves winger advanced towards the Villa penalty area, but letting go of it before he actually went to ground in the box. The Villa midfielder picks up his second yellow for leading with his arm with a challenge on Daniel Podence. More bookings: Ezri Konsa got booked in that incident where Targett got booked for a foul on Traore. Since then, Joao Moutinho has been booked. 82 min: Wolves win a free-kick in a good position outside the Villa penalty area for a Targett foul on Adama Traore. They try a move “from the training ground” (or indeed one they’ve made up on the spot) that ends with Fabio Silva sending the ball into Martinez’s arms with an overhead kick. 80 min: Brilliant play from Pedro Neto on the inside left flank. He tees up Leander Dendoncker for a volley and his effort takes some saving by Emiliano Martinez. Aston Villa substitution: Bertrand Traore off, Anwar El Ghazi on. 78 min: Leander Dendoncker is booked for attempting to pull Conor Coady’s shirt off his back. The Wolves skipper is already on his second jersey of the afternoon and might have needed a third if Dendoncker had his way. 74 min: Moments before that Semedo shot, Marcal looked to have brought down Bertrand Traore in the Wolves penalty area. He got away without conceding a spot-kick as there was an offside in the build-up. Lucky boy. 71 min: It’s been all Wolves since I remarked that Villa were in the ascendency. Emiliano Martinez is forced into action once again, this time saving a Nelson Semedo shot from distance. 70 min: Another good chance goes a begging for Wolves. Emiliano Martinez gets down to his right to keep out a meaty header from Romain Saiss, who was only six yards out when he connected with Neto’s cross. 69 min: In the ascendency but they almost go behind. With Wolves on the attack, P|odence plays the ball into the path of Fabio Silva to his right in the Villa penalty area. He fires across the face of goal first time but the ball thumps off the foot of the upright and rebounds into play. Villa clear. 68 min: It remains scoreless at Molineux but Villa have been in the ascendency in this second half. 67 min: Rui Patricio gets down to his right to save well from Ollie Watkins. The Villa striker’s shot took a deflection off a Wolves defender’s heel and was arrowing towards the bottom corner before the Portuguese goalkeeper intervened to tip it around the post. Nothing comes from the corner. 65 min: Villa win a free-kick a few yards outside the Wolves penalty area, well right of centre. Jack Grealish shapes to cross but then attempts to whip the ball into the near top corner. The ball fizzes high and wide of the angle of upright and crossbar but it wasn’t a bad effort. 62 min: Pedro Neto canters across the face of the Viulla penalty area and unleashes a rasping shot that flashes not too far wide of the upright. Emiliano Martinez was scrambling across his line to get to that one and looks relieved. 61 min: Ollie Watkins tries to hold up the ball on the edge of the Wolves penalty area but is crowded out. This game in a nutshell, more or less. It’s all to play for wqith 30 minutes to go but as things stand this is not a derby that will live long in the memory of all those who are not in Molineux to watch it unfold. 60 min: Daniel Podence is unhappy with Adama Traore for advancing downfield and trying a shot from distance himself, rather than cutting inside and teeing up his team-mate. He voices his displeasure in the strongest possible terms and Traore has the good grace to look suitably sheepish. 57 min: Good work down the right from Cash, who plays the ball inside to Grealish. He jinks this way and that, trying to make room for a shot before rolling the ball elsewhere. Douglas Luiz tries his luck and shoots narrowly wide of the upright. 55 min: Matt Targett blocks a Daniel Podence shot and the ball loops up in the air and into the hands of Emiliano Martinez in the Villa goal. Good defending. 53 min: It’s second time lucky for McGinn, who whips a delightful cross into the Wolves penalty area, aiming for Ollie Watkins. The Villa striker leaps under pressure from Romain Saiss but can’t get his head to the ball. Replays suggest Saiss may have given him a little shove in the back that went unpunished. A let-off for Wolves, perhaps ... but I’d need to see it again. Watkins didn’t appeal. 51 min: Jack Grealish plays a weighted pass up the left flank for McGinn, whose attempted cross is blocked. The ball goes out for a throw-in. 49 min: Conor Coady is dripping claret from his nose after getting hit in the face by the ball as he contested a high ball with Ollie Watkins. Mike Dean blows his whistle to pause play so the Wolves skipper can get himself cleaned up, have a cotton swab wedged up each nostril by the physio and change into a new shirt that doesn’t resemble a crime scene. 46 min: Dendoncker is penalised for handball and Villa are awarded a free-kick halfway inside the Wolves half. Nothing comes of it. 46 min: Villa get the ball rolling with no changes in personnel on either side. Half-time analysis: As is customary on BT Sport, all the focus has been on the first half’s one vaguely contentious refereeing decision. It’s exactly the kind of chat that has football in the state of VAR-induced tedium it is today. So what happened? Wolves defender Romain Saiss ducked to block a Jacob Ramsey flick across the Wolves penalty with his head from almost point-blank range. He knocked the ball on to his own elbow with his forehead and – quite correctly – no penalty was given by Mike Dean, who presumably took advice from the VAR curtain-twitchers. A stop-start game punctuated by free-kicks and niggle draws to a close with the deadlock unbroken. It’s been absorbing fare and both goalkeepers have had saves to make. Villa have dominated possession but Wolves have had the pick of the chances. 45+3 min: Grealish has a low ball across the Wolves penalty area blocked and Wolves counter. Moments later, Mike Dean awards the 17th free-kick of the half, this one for a tug on Adama Traore. The ball’s curled into the Villa penalty area, where Fabio Silva’s header flashes wide of the far post. 45 min: Having failed to draw a foul from Nelson Semedo as he cut into the Wolves penalty area at speed, Jack Grealish shoots for the near post and wins a corner instead. From that, Villa win another but Wolves clear as the clock ticks down to half-time. 44 min: Villa corner. Jack Grealish’s inswinger is cleared at the near post and Villa recycle the ball. It’s sent goalwards and Tyrone Mings nonchalantly flicks it past Rui Patricio. He was only five yards offside ... we won’t need VAR to get involved in that one. 43 min: Another yellow card, this time for Adama Traore. The Wolves winger goes in the book for a foul on John McGinn. 39 min: End to end stuff as Ollie Watkins gallops down the inside left with Conor Coady in hot pursuit, grabbing at his shirt. Wolves put a stop to Villa’s gallop as Watkins tries to find John McGinn and break down the pitch. A Podence shot from distance deflectsa off the shoulder of Jack Grealish, forcing another good save out of Martinez. He tips the ball around the upright and nothing comes from the subsequent corner. 37 min: Wolves win a corner, from which nothing comes but Villa don’t manage to clear it properly. The ball falls to Daniel Podence outside the Villa penalty area and he brings a good one-handed save out of Emiliano Martinez with a low, swerving drive that was heading for the bottom corner. 34 min: Mike Dean blows for a foul on Grealish by Nelson Semedo in the penalty area! Cool your jets Villa fans - it was in your team’s penalty area; your skipper was back attending to his defensive duties. 33 min: A fierce shot from Grealish goes out for a throw-in, which Matty Cash takes long. He Delaps the ball towards the near post, where Ezri Konsa tries to flick it on. The Villa defender miscues his header and the ball almost sneaks in at the upright. Wide ... but not by much. 30 min: Now McGinn gets booked, I suspect for persistent fouling. Daniel Podence is his latest victim. 29 min: Matty Cash gets booked for a foul on Daniel Pedro Neto on the halfway line after the Wolves striker got the wrong side of him. That’s his fifth caution of the season which means he’ll miss Villa’s next game. 28 min: Almost half an hour in and it’s a reasonably entertaining derby, although one without the aggressive snap and crackle you’d expect if the home side were being roared on by a full house of baying Wolves fans. 26 min: Wolves win a free-kick 25 yards from the Villa goal, almost dead centre. Joao Moutinho shapes to take it but rolls the ball to Pedro Neto alongside him instead. He smashes the ball into the defensive wall. 24 min: Jack Grealish goes down clutching his instep after a mid-air collision with Dendoncker which ended with the Wolves midfielder landing on top of him. It’s a sore one but nothing too serious. 22 min: Good play around the Wolves penalty area by Villa, with John McGinn stabbing a nice pass into the box from the left. A promising move ends with debutant Jacob Ramsey firing over the bar from distance. 19 min: The ball sails into the Villa penalty area from the right, but Daniel Podence isn’t tall enough to get on the end of it. Replays of that recent skirmish in the Wolves penalty area suggest a Jacob Ramsey flick may have hit Romain Saiss’s elbow. It was completely unintentional by the Wolves centre-back and his arm was not in an “unnatural” position, but penalties have been given for similar offences in the not too distant past. 18 min: Bertrand Traore curls the ball into the penalty area, a game of pinball ensues and Wolves clear. The arms of several Villa players go up as they appeal for a handball by Romain Saiss. No penalty is forthcoming. 16 min: Outnumbering their opponents in midfield, Villa break forward and Jack Grealish wins a free-kick just outside the Wolves penalty area, in line with the left edge. Adama Traore the aggressor there. 14 min: Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz gets booked by referee Mike Dean for clipping the heels of Fabio Silva as the young striker tried to break upfield from the halfway line. 12 min: Tyrone Mings loses the ball near the halfway line and Wolves break upfield. Neto gallops forward and tries to pull the ball back for Silva, but Martinez is quick off his line to claim the ball and gets a boot to the head for his troubles. It doesn’t look particularly serious and he’s fit to carry on. 10 min: Fernando Marcal curls a low cross into the Villa penalty area from the left touchline, trying to pick out Podence or Silva. Martinez shouts for the ball and gets down to clutch it to his chest. 10 min: |Villa are dominating possession at the moment, with 63% in the opening nine minutes. 8 min: John McGinn whips a cross into the Wolves penalty area which is put out for another Villa corner. Grealish plays this one short, takes the ball back, advances towards goal and tries to pull the ball back to Bertrand Traore. Wolves clear. 6 min: Grealish’s delivery travels uninterrupted through the Wolves penalty area and out for a throw-in by the corner flag at the opposite side of the pitch. 6 min: Corner for Villa, after John McGinn tries to get in behind Leander Dendoncker, who puts the ball out. 4 min: Aston Villa enjoy their first spell of possession after a shaky start. Grealish gets on the ball in the centre circle and tries to send Douglas Luiz on his way but the midfielder runs into traffic. 2 min: Wolves take the corner short and send a cross towards the far post. Aston Villa clear their lines. 1 min: Daniel Podence gets an early cross in from the right, trying to pick out Fabio Silva. The young Portuguese tries to get on the end of the excellent delivery, but Matty Cash rises with him and flicks the ball out for a corner. 1 min: The players take a knee and play begins with Wolves looking like they’re lining up with a back four, all the better to facilitate the link-up play between Nelson Semedo and Adama Traore down the right hand side. Aston Villa left-back Matt Targett could have his hands full this afternoon. Not long now: The sun is shining over Molineux but it’s a shame there are no fans in the stadium to enjoy its warmth on their shoulders. They’ll be watching at home, however, as their team leaves the dressing room and the players make their way out on to the pitch. Aston Villa’s players join them, making their way down the steps of one stand adjacent to the tunnel. The last of the pre-match niceties are under way and we’ll be kicking off in less than two minutes. Jacob Ramsey: A product of the Villa academy who has been out on loan at Doncaster Rovers, the 19-year-old can play as a central or attacking midfielder and makes his first start for the club today. Fabio Silva starts up front for Wolves, the 19-year-old making his first Premier League start. Behind him, Ruben Neves and Wily Boly are dropped, with Romain Saiss coming into defence. Villa have a teenager of their own making his top flight debut, with Jacob Ramsey starting in place of Conor Hourihane. They mystery player rumoured to have picked up an injury is Trezeguet, who has suffered a laceration to his head and isn’t in the matchday squad - Bertrand Traore comes in for him. Nine of today’s Villa team have started every Premier League match this season. Wolverhampton Wanderers: Patricio, Saiss, Coady, Marcal, Semedo, Moutinho, Dendoncker, Podence, Traore, Silva, Neto. Subs: Ruddy, Ait-Nouri, Neves, Boly, Vitinha, Kilman, Otasowie. Aston Villa: Martinez, Cash, Konsa, Mings, Targett, Luiz, McGinn, Ramsey, Traore, Watkins, Grealish. Subs: Steer, Hourihane, Nakamba, El Ghazi, Guilbert, Elmohamady, Hause. Referee: Mike Dean Assistants: Darren Coan and Mark Scholes Fourth official: Robert Jones VAR: Graham Scott “I think we are certainly closer to them than we were last season,” says the Aston Villa manager, who are in twelfth place, two points and two places behind Wolves. “With the quality we have added to our team I believe we have certainly done that.” Speaking about Jack Grealish and Ross Barkley’s breach of coronavirus regulations after the pair attended a birthday dinner in London last weekend, Smith said he had dealt with the matter. “Has this week been difficult to handle?” he asked. “No. I spoke about it and gave my opinions. I have reminded the players about their responsibilities and we have moved on.” Grealish, now on his second strike as far as covid shenanigans are concerned, has since tested negative negative for the virus and can play today. “We are fully aware of what it means to play against Aston Villa,” said the Wolves manager in his pre-match press conference. “It’s always a big match and means a lot to our fans. Unfortunately, they will not be in Molineux to give us a push, but for sure they’ll be supporting at home and wishing us the best. We have to compete with all our strength. “It’s a difficult game. It will require from us consistency through the actions, the unit compact, and taking advantage when we have the ball with the talented players we have – having good possession to unbalance Villa. “We expect a very tough game, for sure, and a very enthusiastic game. It’s a derby and they’re always special.” Early Aston Villa team news Aston Villa have had a fortnight off due to the postponement of their match against Newcastle last weekend, a break that’s given Dean Smith’s squad an unexpected opportunity to rest and recuperate. He has a largely fit squad to choose from but is without one big name in Ross Barkley, the midfielder currently sidelined with a hamstring injury. The word from Molineux is that Smith has one other player who started their most recent game against West Ham unavailable through injury, but the identity of the man in question is not yet in the public domain. Early Wolves team news ... Wolves are without striker Raul Jimenez for the forseeable future following the fractured skull he suffered in their recent win over Arsenal. The Mexican paid a welcome visit to the club’s training ground during the week and may attend this afternoon’s game if his doctor gives him permission. We wish him well in his recovery. Back in training after undergoing surgery on a knee injury, Jonny will not play today. Wolves entertain Aston Villa in this Saturday lunchtime West Midlands derby (other West Midlands derbies are available), with both teams hoping to get back to winning ways after defeats in their most recent Premier League outings. Kick-off at Molineux is at 12.30pm (GMT) but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

As authorities press ahead with logistical plans for the country’s biggest ever public health programme, the Church of England said offers by churches to turn over their buildings were “a great act of service and witness”. But the C of E also warned that requirements were “likely to be quite demanding” and that many church properties were unsuitable. In guidance issued to clergy and church officials, the C of E said: “Most of the vaccination hubs being set up are expecting to process upwards of 1,000 people a day – they need large spaces that are not needed for any other purposes, and that can be kept for the purposes of vaccinations for up to a year.” Blackburn cathedral is expected to open as a mass vaccination centre in the next two weeks. Public health officials are turning the cathedral’s 1,300 square metre crypt into a “sort of field hospital”, said Peter Howell -Jones, the dean. The vaccination centre will be open 12 hours a day, seven days a week. “Our location is perfect – two minutes’ walk from the train station, three minutes’ walk from the bus station, and we have five car parks around us,” Howell-Jones said. The cathedral will be unable to use its crypt for at least a year, although activities in the main part of the building, including worship, will be unaffected. Rochester cathedral, in Kent, the second oldest in England, opened last week as a community rapid-testing centre for people without Covid symptoms who live in a high-risk area. The army has installed 10 booths in the cathedral’s crypt, which was restored with lottery funding four years ago, and an additional accessible booth outside. The testing centre will be capable of processing hundreds of people every day of the week, and they will get their test results within an hour. Medway, which encompasses Rochester, currently has one of the highest Covid infection rates in the country, with more than 600 cases per 100,000 people. The cathedral was founded in 604, with the oldest parts of the current building dating from 1080. “The crypt will be effectively sealed off, so we can still have a limited number of services in the nave,” said Simon Lace, the chapter clerk. “There’s been so little we’ve been able to do during the pandemic, so we were keen to help.

Foxes are scaring the hens and lambs, so on Winter Bird/When Winter Comes, he’s got to see to the fence. Once that’s sorted, he might tackle the drainage issues in the carrot bed. Maybe he’ll get round to planting some trees to shade future generations.</p> <p>Those with long memories might recognise the Paul McCartney at work on this track, and on swaths of <em>McCartney III</em>: it’s the back-to-land fugitive of his first solo album, <em>McCartney</em> (1970). Conceived as the Beatles were fractiously imploding, it was very much the work of a cultural powerhouse in a tailspin, resetting his dials on a Scottish farm with his young family.</p> <p>Sheltering in place, at one remove from a difficult world, contemplating some gardening – it’s not hard to find parallels with what McCartney calls “rockdown”. Much of his 2020 should have been filled with a Glastonbury headline slot and other touring engagements, but instead resulted in the unscripted <em>McCartney III</em>. The rogue element of fortune is echoed in the album’s artwork, an <a href=\"https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/ed-ruscha-paul-mccartney-3-graphic-design-art-221020\">Ed Ruscha commission</a> that shows a die poised on its point, three dots to the fore. It seems to ask: what are the chances?</p> <p>As with both previous self-titled McCartney records – <em>McCartney II</em> followed in 1980, as Wings were folding – the former Beatle wrote, played and produced everything himself on <em>III</em>. This strand of numbered solo albums is, famously, looser and more experimental than McCartney’s more nipped and tucked commercial work.

      "bodyText": "The song that closes Paul McCartney’s latest solo album transcribes the to-do list of a man living a simpler life. Foxes are scaring the hens and lambs, so on Winter Bird/When Winter Comes, he’s got to see to the fence. Once that’s sorted, he might tackle the drainage issues in the carrot bed. Maybe he’ll get round to planting some trees to shade future generations. Those with long memories might recognise the Paul McCartney at work on this track, and on swaths of McCartney III: it’s the back-to-land fugitive of his first solo album, McCartney (1970). Conceived as the Beatles were fractiously imploding, it was very much the work of a cultural powerhouse in a tailspin, resetting his dials on a Scottish farm with his young family. Sheltering in place, at one remove from a difficult world, contemplating some gardening – it’s not hard to find parallels with what McCartney calls “rockdown”. Much of his 2020 should have been filled with a Glastonbury headline slot and other touring engagements, but instead resulted in the unscripted McCartney III. The rogue element of fortune is echoed in the album’s artwork, an Ed Ruscha commission that shows a die poised on its point, three dots to the fore. It seems to ask: what are the chances? As with both previous self-titled McCartney records – McCartney II followed in 1980, as Wings were folding – the former Beatle wrote, played and produced everything himself on III. This strand of numbered solo albums is, famously, looser and more experimental than McCartney’s more nipped and tucked commercial work. There are a few more resonanceswith ’69-’70: then, Linda McCartney took the pictures. In 2020, daughter Mary McCartney fulfilled that role. She was the baby peeking out from McCartney’s big coat on the 1970 album’s flipside. Photography is uppermost in McCartney’s mind on a song called Pretty Boys, a meditation about fame. As one of the most snapped humans on the planet, it’s easy to hear “meet the pretty boys… objects of desire” as a rumination on the Beatles as a boyband. But as a man who was once married to a photographer, McCartney can bring nuance to the study. “Try to feel the light,” he sings. On this varied record, abounding in chiaroscuro, light is both literal and metaphorical. It recurs as a theme on a work that mostly privileges love and positivity – although not exclusively.
