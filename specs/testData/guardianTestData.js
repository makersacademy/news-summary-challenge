She now aims to seal her intercontinental appeal with her first Christmas album.</p> <p>Flanked with beautifully arranged backings that emphasise the “big” in big band, you initially worry she oversells these standards. Where Bing Crosby made the public service announcement of Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town seemingly to a child on his knee, Jessie blares it almost threateningly, as if from a cop car announcing a curfew. On the original Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree, Brenda Lee was like a hostess amenably offering you a crispy prawn; at this party, Jessie barges to the fireplace and suggests everyone do a turn, starting with her. Every note, no matter how short, is spritzed with earnest vibrato, and also occasionally toasted with vocal fry. But if your Christmas involves a 12ft illuminated Santa on the lawn, eggnog on the breakfast table and red glitter on everything, you will find much to love here.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lostinshowbiz/2018/apr/19/jessie-js-cultural-revolution-how-a-middle-grade-pop-monster-saved-china\">Jessie J’s cultural revolution: how a Middle-Grade Pop Monster saved China</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some swingtime innovations, such as singing the chorus to Let It Snow jazzily off-beat, are unforgivable, but Jessie’s sheer technical prowess makes Jingle Bell Rock and Man With the Bag sparkle like the Rockefeller tree. A symphonic pop-rap mashup of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Jingle Bells is actually about a tenth as monstrous as it sounds, helped by a rather lovely middle eight and the firm hands of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on the boards. A peppy jazz kit keeps Winter Wonderland skipping along, even as Boyz II Men turn up to histrionically deliver lines such as “we’ll have lots of fun with Mr Snowman” as if Mr Snowman has told them it’s just not working out and they’re trying to convince him otherwise. And a waltzing, Babyface-produced take on The Christmas Song is perfectly judged, with the kind of sax solo that, played live in a mall on Christmas Eve, would have harried shoppers slowing to exchange chastened smiles with one another.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/5FVQjSLBVMdWaZYD4vf3gS\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5FVQjSLBVMdWaZYD4vf3gS\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

Flanked with beautifully arranged backings that emphasise the “big” in big band, you initially worry she oversells these standards. Where Bing Crosby made the public service announcement of Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town seemingly to a child on his knee, Jessie blares it almost threateningly, as if from a cop car announcing a curfew. On the original Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree, Brenda Lee was like a hostess amenably offering you a crispy prawn; at this party, Jessie barges to the fireplace and suggests everyone do a turn, starting with her. Every note, no matter how short, is spritzed with earnest vibrato, and also occasionally toasted with vocal fry. But if your Christmas involves a 12ft illuminated Santa on the lawn, eggnog on the breakfast table and red glitter on everything, you will find much to love here.\nSome swingtime innovations, such as singing the chorus to Let It Snow jazzily off-beat, are unforgivable, but Jessie’s sheer technical prowess makes Jingle Bell Rock and Man With the Bag sparkle like the Rockefeller tree. A symphonic pop-rap mashup of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Jingle Bells is actually about a tenth as monstrous as it sounds, helped by a rather lovely middle eight and the firm hands of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on the boards. A peppy jazz kit keeps Winter Wonderland skipping along, even as Boyz II Men turn up to histrionically deliver lines such as “we’ll have lots of fun with Mr Snowman” as if Mr Snowman has told them it’s just not working out and they’re trying to convince him otherwise. And a waltzing, Babyface-produced take on The Christmas Song is perfectly judged, with the kind of sax solo that, played live in a mall on Christmas Eve, would have harried shoppers slowing to exchange chastened smiles with one another.",

                                            "html": "<p>The game programmer, based in Portsmouth, spoke of his experience of working 80-hour weeks, back to back, as an intern after university. “It’s a very passion -driven industry in which many people are just happy to be making games for a living and in my own case it took a year to begin to feel tired and I began to make a conscious effort to work less,” he said.</p> \n<p>Several studios have been involved in controversies over working conditions. Rockstar was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/oct/18/rockstar-games-working-conditions-red-dead-redemption-2-rob-nelson\">defend its working conditions</a> after a New York magazine profile in which its British co-founder Dan Houser spoke of working 100-hour weeks before the release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/oct/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review-western-playstation-xbox-rockstar\">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> in October.</p> \n<p>While companies such as Rockstar have insisted that they are working to improve welfare and conditions, <a href=\"https://www.igda.org/resource/resmgr/2017_DSS_/!IGDA_DSS_2017_SummaryReport.pdf\">a global survey last year</a> by the International Games Developers Association (IGDA) found that “crunch” was still a problem, with 51% reporting that it still featured in their job.</p> \n<p>The GWU UK, <a href=\"http://www.gwu-uk.org/join/\">which is signing up members from </a><a href=\"http://www.gwu-uk.org/join/\">Friday</a> and will hold an <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/game-workers-unite-national-meeting-161218-tickets-53393196488\">inaugural meeting</a> on Sunday to elect an executive, follows on from a movement that originally sprung up online and at games conventions in the US. An online community of 200 workers in Britain has already formed around the GWU UK. It decided to organise under the umbrella of the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB) union, which has been building an increasing profile among workers in sectors that have not traditionally been unionised to a great degree.</p> \n<p>The games sector is worth nearly £3bn to the UK economy and employs more than 47,000 people in companies that range from tiny studios to large operations employing hundreds.</p> \n<p>Along with campaigning on pay and conditions, Bianco and his fellow union members also plan to take a stand against racism and sexism in an industry still largely dominated by white men.</p> \n<p>“The sheer existence of women in games is enough to spur hate mobs in some cases. We’ve known of people trawling through the social media accounts of new employees and asking for them to be forced out if it was discovered, for example, that they were following feminist figures,” he said.</p> \n<p>“If anything, things are getting worse in some ways. It’s tied into trends such as the rise of the alt-right or a general hostility towards what is seen as political correctness. Companies have not been great at speaking out about this. They don’t want to poke the bear. We want to take a stand.”</p> \n<p>Reacting to the initiative, the chief executive of the Independent Game Developers’ Association (Tiga), Richard Wilson, said it was “completely neutral” on the issue of unionisation but said “crunch” was increasingly becoming a thing of the past. Wilson said his “overriding impression” of the industry was that it was a very welcoming one.</p> \n<p>“I think the structure of games development is such that it is very team-orientated one as well. The bonds are likely to be much stronger than in other sectors,” he said, adding that about two-thirds of studios employed four people or fewer.</p> \n<p>“Some studios do engage in crunch behaviour and Rockstar is the most recent example of that, but I also know that many studios do not go down that route because they would view it as a miscalculation of management.”</p> \n<p>Jodie Azhar, a Bafta-winning former technical art director at the developer Creative Assembly, recently founded her own company, Teazelcat, aiming to build a studio culture that supported staff and promoted wellbeing. She welcomed the push to unionise the sector.</p>"

                                "bodyTextSummary": "A former British soldier jailed in Turkey for more than seven years after joining a Kurdish group fighting Islamic State has secretly fled the country and returned home. Joe Robinson, 25, was on bail pending an appeal against his sentence on terrorism charges after he volunteered for the People’s Protection Units of Syrian Kurdistan (YPG), which Turkey considers a terrorist organisation. He fled the country and returned to the UK without the permission of the Turkish courts, the BBC reported. He had begged the British government for help, saying he was emotionally drained by his ordeal. Robinson was accused of fighting with the US-backed YPG in Syria, but he claims he was volunteering as a combat medic for the Kurdish group for a month in 2015. He told the BBC he was getting his human rights back by fleeing Turkey, and that he had been obliged to take matters into his own hands. “I could not accept the sentence and charges as I am not a criminal,” he said. Robinson, who is from Accrington in Lancashire, originally travelled to Syria in July 2015, telling his family he had gone to join the French Foreign Legion.

He returned to the UK in November 2015 and police arrested him at Manchester airport on suspicion of terrorism offences, but all charges were dropped after he spent 10 months on bail. When he returned to the region last year, he was arrested on a Turkish beach. He and his fiancee, Mira Rojkan, were on holiday at the resort of Didim in south-west Turkey, when the authorities arrested and charged him with terrorism offences.\nRojkan, 23, a Bulgarian national, was also arrested and given a suspended sentence for “terrorism propaganda” after apparently sharing Facebook posts with the Kurdish flag and links to Kurdish songs on YouTube. Robinson was convicted in September and sentenced to seven and a half years in prison. Turkey considers the YPG to be affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which has been involved in an armed struggle against the state for decades. The YPG denies any affiliation, and is not a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK. Robinson, who toured Afghanistan with the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment in 2012, spent four months in jail last year after his arrest in July. He was released on bail in November, but was not allowed to leave the country. His family issued an appeal for his release last year.

He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/24/briton-held-in-turkey-on-terrorism-charges-released-on-bail\">released on bail in November</a>, but was not allowed to leave the country.</p> \n<p>His family <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/24/family-theresa-may-uk-soldier-turkey-isis-joe-robinson\">issued </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/24/family-theresa-may-uk-soldier-turkey-isis-joe-robinson\">an appeal for his release last year</a>. His mother, Sharon, said at the time: “He hasn’t done anything wrong. He’s committed no crime here, and none in Syria where he’s accused of committing a crime. So how is it wrong in a country he just went on holiday to?”</p> \n<p>Ben Keith, a barrister specialising in extradition cases, said Robinson faced the risk of extradition back to Turkey but that he would have a human rights defence to challenge the case in court.</p> \n<p>He added: “Turkey’s human rights situation is diabolical at the moment and so there are all sorts of problems with fair trial rights, and torture is systemic.” </p> \n<p>The Foreign Office is not thought to have facilitated Robinson’s return to the UK. A spokesman said: “The FCO has previously confirmed the provision of consular support to Mr Robinson.”</p> \n<p>Hundreds of foreign nationals, including Britons, have travelled to Syria in recent years to fight against Isis. Another former British soldier, James Matthews, 43, accused of attending terrorist training camps run by the YPG, had charges against him dropped in the UK in July after the crown concluded there was no longer a realistic prospect of a conviction.</p> \n<p>Matthews, from east London, had pleaded not guilty to the charge of receiving instruction or training in Iraq and Syria on or before 15 February 2016 “for purposes connected to the commission of preparation of terrorism”.</p>"

He may not be a million-to-one shot like the celluloid brawler his nickname evokes, but against the classy Álvarez the task will be no less daunting.</p> \n<p>Cynical as the framing may be, it was difficult to not feel happy for Fielding before Thursday’s final press conference as he reflected on his improbable journey: the amateur background he described as “average”, the professional debut at a leisure center in front of 500 people with no promotional backing, the afternoons spent hawking tickets in shopping centre car parks for his own fights. And now this.</p> \n<p>Only a few months ago Fielding had been looking forward to potential defenses against either James DeGale or Chris Eubank Jr when he received a life-changing phone call as he was putting his then-one-month-old daughter to bed.</p> \n<p>“My phone rings and [trainer Jamie Moore] says: ‘Canelo wants to fight you,’” he recalled. “I didn’t even ask how much it was. Canelo wants to fight you? OK. What a challenge that is. I’m a fighter. I don’t say no to fights.”</p> \n<p>Fielding admitted he has been keenly aware of the perception surrounding his role: that of a well-compensated walkover in DAZN’s glossy subscription drive. But he insisted that no amount of negative chatter will deter him from Saturday’s golden opportunity.</p> \n<p>“In the past I might have been bitter,” he said. “But I’ve worked so hard and here I am: main event at Madison Square Garden. I’ve got two children and they’re who I’m doing it for. [It’s] for family and myself and the challenge.”</p> \n<p>And a challenge it will surely be. The redhead from Guadalajara, who had two stints as a junior middleweight title-holder before climbing to middleweight, has not officially lost a fight since a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/15/floyd-mayweather-beats-canelo-alvarez\" title=\"\">majority-decision defeat to Floyd Mayweather</a> when he was 23, even if many believe Golovkin was the true winner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/17/canelo-alvarez-ggg-golovkin-fight-draw\" title=\"\">last year’s first instalment</a>, which ended in a highly disputed split draw.</p>"

Beginning its fifth season on Saturday, however, there is a sense that it is in a position to deliver the drama such grand stages demand, now boasting technology, drivers and manufacturers coming together with greater coherence and credibility than ever.</p> <p>The new season opens in Riyadh, the first of 13 races held across 12 meetings. There will be no race in the UK, which has not held FE since its last appearance in London’s Battersea Park in the second season, but other cities including New York, Paris, Rome, Hong Kong, Berlin and Monaco will all play host to the series that held its first round in 2014. Four years on the racing has fundamentally changed for the better.</p> <p>For its first four seasons the drivers were required to change cars mid-race, because the battery capacity was unable to run a car for the requisite number of laps. It was a glaring drawback that left many unable to take it seriously and far from ideal in promoting electric power.</p> <p>This season Formula E introduces its second generation car, known as Gen2.

                                "bodyTextSummary": "Formula E has always enjoyed grand city centre destinations as a central tenet of the all-electric series. Beginning its fifth season on Saturday, however, there is a sense that it is in a position to deliver the drama such grand stages demand, now boasting technology, drivers and manufacturers coming together with greater coherence and credibility than ever. The new season opens in Riyadh, the first of 13 races held across 12 meetings. There will be no race in the UK, which has not held FE since its last appearance in London’s Battersea Park in the second season, but other cities including New York, Paris, Rome, Hong Kong, Berlin and Monaco will all play host to the series that held its first round in 2014. Four years on the racing has fundamentally changed for the better. For its first four seasons the drivers were required to change cars mid-race, because the battery capacity was unable to run a car for the requisite number of laps. It was a glaring drawback that left many unable to take it seriously and far from ideal in promoting electric power. This season Formula E introduces its second generation car, known as Gen2. With the battery capacity doubled, a single car can now race to the finish. The cars will use up to 250 kW of power, with a top speed of almost 280 km/h.\nThe BBC will show all the races online or on the red button, with one on terrestrial television.

The moment you start using these components in a competitive environment they develop so quickly. That will just keep going and that will help everyone, FE and the motoring industry.</p> \n<p>“The car is very hard to drive, especially on street circuits that are tight and twisty.

                                "bodyTextSummary": "A Mahatma Gandhi statue has been removed from the campus of the University of Ghana after protests from students and faculty who argue the Indian independence leader considered Africans “inferior”. The statue was unveiled at the university in the Ghanian capital Accra two years ago but has been the subject of controversy and was removed in the middle of the night on Tuesday, leaving just an empty plinth. Scholars have highlighted evidence in past years showing the revered freedom-fighter, whose theories of civil resistance helped India throw off British colonialism and inspired generations of activists including Martin Luther King Jr, held derogatory views towards native communities in South Africa.\nA 2015 book by two South African writers pointed to instances where Gandhi complained that Indians were being forced to use the same separate entrances as Africans, meaning “their civilised habits … would be degraded to the habits of aboriginal natives”. “About the mixing of the Kaffirs with the Indians, I must confess I feel most strongly,” he wrote in a letter in 1904. More sympathetic students of Gandhi’s life say his views were ignorant and prejudiced but a product of their time, and that his campaigns for social justice hold universal resonance and have fuelled some civil rights activism in Africa. Students at the university welcomed the decision to remove the statue. “It’s a massive win for all Ghanaians because it was constantly reminding us of how inferior we are,” Benjamin Mensah told Agence France-Presse. The head of language, literature and drama at the Institute of African Studies, Obadele Kambon, said the removal was an issue of “self-respect”. “If we show that we have no respect for ourselves and look down on our own heroes and praise others who had no respect for us, then there is an issue,” he said. “If we indeed don’t show any self-respect for our heroes, how can the world respect us? This is victory for black dignity and self-respect. The campaign has paid off.” Ghana’s former government had said the statue would be relocated to prevent the controversy from “becoming a distraction from our strong ties of friendship” with India. But two years later the statue had still not been relocated. Campaigners in Malawi are trying to stop another Gandhi statue from being erected in the country’s second city, Blantyre.

This is victory for black dignity and self-respect. The campaign has paid off.”</p> \n<p>Ghana’s former government had said the statue would be relocated to prevent the controversy from “becoming a distraction from our strong ties of friendship” with India.
