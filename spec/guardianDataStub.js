The thing to understand here – you’ve got a flurry at the moment of things happening in politics, but this happens to all governments at some point or other.” Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a 38-year-old project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has been in prison since her arrest in Tehran in April last year, when she and her infant daughter were about to board a flight back to the UK. Pressure has been building on Johnson since he told the foreign affairs select committee earlier this month that he believed she had been “simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it”. Her family were outraged by the comments, saying they were entirely inaccurate and place her at further risk. They insist Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has dual British-Iranian nationality, was on holiday.

Two polls at the beginning of this year predicted a vote of more than 20%.</p> <p>A vote of 18% would be quite high for a minor party, but our electoral system does not neatly translate votes into seats.

The party polled 22.7% of the vote, overtaking the separate Liberal and National parties to come second. The two Coalition parties collectively polled 31%, while Labor managed almost 39%.</p> <p>With this vote, One Nation came in the top two in 33 out of 89 state electorates, but managed to win only in 11.</p> <p>It tended to do well in regional areas, but not so well in Brisbane. Its strongest areas encompassed all the seats in the Ipswich area, as well as large rural electorates up the coast and further inland.

        "bodyText": "Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party has burst back on to the Australian political scene after last year’s federal election, when it won four Senate seats, and has surged in the polls since then. Recent polling suggests it will make a big impact in this month’s Queensland state election. Seven polls since May 2017 have shown One Nation’s vote between 15% and 18%, and last week’s Galaxy poll put the party on 18%. Two polls at the beginning of this year predicted a vote of more than 20%. A vote of 18% would be quite high for a minor party, but our electoral system does not neatly translate votes into seats. There are a lot of factors that will influence how many seats One Nation could win if its vote is as high as polls suggest. One Nation’s first electoral test came in the 1998 Queensland election, as a prelude to the federal election that year. The party polled 22.7% of the vote, overtaking the separate Liberal and National parties to come second. The two Coalition parties collectively polled 31%, while Labor managed almost 39%. With this vote, One Nation came in the top two in 33 out of 89 state electorates, but managed to win only in 11. It tended to do well in regional areas, but not so well in Brisbane. Its strongest areas encompassed all the seats in the Ipswich area, as well as large rural electorates up the coast and further inland. It also did quite well in smaller coastal towns, but not in Cairns and Townsville. It won seats off Labor and the Nationals. The party’s candidates defeated six MPs of Labor and five from the National party. Of the 33 seats where it came in the top two, 20 of those contests were against Labor. This showed Labor had polled much higher than the conservative parties. A lot has changed since 1998. The former Coalition parties have merged, the voting system has changed, and One Nation, which was dormant for more than a decade, is a lot more active now. We can’t use recent state election results to judge where One Nation might perform best – the party ran only 11 candidates at the last state election, and polled less than 1% of the vote. But it did manage more than 9% of the statewide vote in the Senate at last year’s federal election. This data has been broken down at the state electoral level by Alex Jago, and gives us a sense of the places where One Nation would be expected to do best. The pattern is similar to what we saw in 1998: urban fringe, small regional towns and large rural electorates, on the coast and inland. The party’s vote was highest in the Ipswich fringe seat of Lockyer, where Hanson came close to victory at the 2015 state election. One Nation does slightly better in Liberal National party seats, but is still a threat in several Labor seats in places such as Townsville and Ipswich. If One Nation polls as high as 18%, it will come in the top two, on primary votes, in many seats – but that won’t be enough to win seats. In most places, the party will not be in a position to win on primary votes, and will require preferences from other candidates. The preference system has changed since the last election – voters will now be required to number every box. This means more preferences will play a role in deciding the result. It will also make it easier for a candidate in second place to catch up on a rival. Labor and the Greens have declared they will not give preferences to One Nation.

Switzerland v Northern Ireland (12 Nov, first leg 1-0) Greece v Croatia (12 Nov, first leg 1-4) Italy v Sweden (13 Nov, first leg 0-1) Republic of Ireland v Denmark (14 Nov, first leg 0-0) South America (Conmebol) Brazil became the first team to qualify for Russia during a nine-game winning run, putting their 2014 nightmare behind them. Uruguay looked odds-on for qualification for much of their campaign but it took a final-round victory over Bolivia to make certain. Argentina have had their close calls in qualifying before but left it late even by their standards. They travelled to Ecuador needing to win but went behind after 37 seconds. Enter Lionel Messi, whose hat-trick carried Jorge Sampaoli’s team to Russia after Chile lost in Brazil to miss out altogether. Paraguay’s 1-0 home defeat to Venezuela ended their hopes, leaving Peru and Colombia battling for fourth place in Lima. A 1-1 draw meant the visitors qualified automatically while Peru, chasing their first World Cup appearance since 1982, finished fifth and will play off against New Zealand. Qualified: Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Colombia Play-offs: Peru North and Central America (Concacaf) Mexico cruised through the six-team final group and never looked in danger of missing out after beating the USA in Columbus in the first game. Costa Rica have also qualified but not without late drama as Kendall Waston’s 95th-minute penalty got the point they needed against Honduras. USA struggled throughout their campaign and fell 2-1 down to Trinidad &amp; Tobago in their final game. That meant a Panama win over Costa Rica would see them into their first World Cup, and Román Torres struck with only two minutes left. USA dropped to fifth in the table, missing their first finals since 1986, after Honduras fought back to beat Mexico and claim a play-off place. Qualified: Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama Play-offs: Honduras Asia (AFC) Iran were the first Asian team to qualify, and did so way back in June with a 2-0 win over Uzbekistan. Carlos Queiroz’s side topped the group with maximum efficiency – going unbeaten with 10 goals in 10 games. South Korea came second in Group A to secure their ninth consecutive appearance at a World Cup finals. In Group B, a tight three-way battle ended with Japan topping the group, one point ahead of Saudi Arabia who qualified after edging out Australia on goal difference. The Socceroos narrowly prevailed in a two-legged play-off with surprise package Syria, and will now face Concacaf’s fourth-placed side for a place at the finals. Qualified: Iran, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia Play-off winners: Australia Africa (Caf) Morocco are back at a World Cup finals for the first time since France ‘98 after an unbeaten campaign ended with a 2-0 win over nearest rivals Ivory Coast. Goals from Nabil Dirar and Mehdi Benatia sealed victory in Abidjan, while Tunisia squeezed through with a 0-0 draw against Libya, denying DR Congo in Group A. Senegal won 2-0 in South Africa to seal their first finals appearance since 2002, in a game that was replayed after the referee in the first fixture was suspended. Nigeria dominated a tough group containing Zambia, Cameroon and a disappointing Algeria side to reach the finals for the sixth time. Egypt complete a strong North African contingent – the Pharoahs sealed qualification with a dramatic late win over Congo for their first World Cup appearance since 1990. In the interim, they have won the Africa Cup of Nations four times. Qualified: Nigeria, Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia, Morocco. Intercontinental play-offs Honduras, Peru and Australia earned another chance at qualification alongside Oceania winners New Zealand. The first legs both ended goalless, giving Peru and Australia an advantage ahead of the second legs, when the final two places will be filled. Peru v New Zealand (15 Nov, first leg 0-0) Australia v Honduras (15 Nov, first leg 0-0)",

One of these great footballing countries will have a chance to right that wrong next summer in Russia. But only one.</p> <p><strong>Denmark are 19th in the Fifa rankings, six places above the Republic of Ireland, so go into this two-legged World Cup qualification play-off as favourites.</strong> Christian Eriksen of Tottenham Hotspur is the man who usually brings home the bacon for the Danes; he’s scored in seven of their ten qualifiers so far. Ireland boss Martin O’Neill has the midfielder pegged in a world-class bracket alongside the likes of Gareth Bale, Eden Hazard, Luis Suarez and Neymar. It’s going to be a big test for the Irish in Copenhagen tonight.</p> <p><strong>But they’ll be up for it; O’Neill’s men always are. </strong>Denmark might have lost just one of their last home matches, but Ireland are a steely proposition on the road: they’re six unbeaten on their travels. Their last trip, away to a Bale-free Wales, ended in the win which earned them a place in this play-off. They boast no stars of the world stage – the most creative member of their squad is a 35-year-old from Norwich City who probably won’t start – but then that’s not really the point. Time and again, Ireland prove beyond doubt that they’re a <em>team</em>, one much greater than the sum of its parts.</p> <p><strong>Both sides will be dreaming of Russia, and legitimately so. </strong>Will Denmark take a big step towards their first finals since 2010? Or will Ireland set themselves up for glory back in Dublin on Tuesday night, in their quest to reach the World Cup for the first time since that mind-bending summer 15 years ago? We’ll soon find out ... because this, ladies and gentlemen, is on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>7.45pm GMT, 8.45pm in Copenhagen.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-11T18:39:10.565Z\">at 6.39pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

Advantage to Martin O’Neill’s well-organised side ahead of the return leg in Dublin on Tuesday! 90 min +4: Larsen tries to curl one into the top right from distance. Nope. 90 min +3: ... Conor Hourihane. 90 min +2: Ireland eventually clear their lines. Then they take ages to make a substitution. Hendrick is replaced by ... 90 min +1: There will be three added minutes. Ireland don’t really clear the corner. The ball very nearly breaks to Eriksen on the edge of the box. It squirts to the left, allowing Larsen to take a shot from the left of the D. The ball deflects off Christie and sails inches wide of the left-hand post! 90 min: Ireland have just gone close, so Denmark respond. Space for Larsen down the left. He curls a cross onto the head of Poulsen, who sends the ball straight at Randolph from six yards. The keeper tips acrobatically over! 89 min: O’Dowda turns on the jets and bursts past Kvist in the middle of the park. He’s brought down. A clear free kick, and under normal circumstances a booking, but not according to this ref’s policy, and on balance that’s fair enough. Brady loops the free kick into the box. Duffy plants a header goalwards, and Schmeichel does very well to deal with it. 88 min: Arter jogs off, to be replaced by Glenn Whelan. 87 min: Delaney hooks a cross into the Ireland box from the left. It’s too high for Poulsen. Goal kick. Whistles from the crowd as Arter goes down in the area, messing around with his boots. 85 min: McClean has a dig from 30 yards. Nope. Time ticks on. 84 min: McClean clips the back of Delaney’s heels in the centre circle. That could have been an expensive yellow for Ireland, too, but the referee appears minded to let things pass. Long has a crack from the right of the Danish D. It twangs off the back of the unfortunate Delaney and out for a corner on the left. But the referee points for a goal kick. Not everything has gone Ireland’s way during this minute. 82 min: Eriksen tries to release Ankersen into the Irish area with a little pitching wedge down the right. It doesn’t come off. Denmark’s star man has been very quiet in this second half. 81 min: A free kick for Ireland out on the right. Brady curls it in. It’s slightly flat. Clark stoops to flick one on, but only manages to send the ball harmlessly wide left of the target. 79 min: Ireland push an increasingly nervous Denmark back, earning a corner on the left. Brady whips it in; Bendtner clears. Denmark threaten to break dangerously. Kvist bombs up the right. Arter tugs him back, and should be booked. But the referee is kind. Arter is one of the players who would miss the second leg with a yellow card. He’s got away with that. 77 min: Bendtner chases after Arter in the midfield. Arter slides to hoof the ball upfield for O’Dowda. Bendtner lands on Arter’s leg. A lot of screaming. For a second, everyone fears the worst. But while it’s a sore one, Arter is good to continue. And it wasn’t an intentional foul; Bendtner accidentally landed on Arter’s leg while looking upfield. A bit of a brouhaha, but it quickly ends in nothing. 75 min: Jorgensen cuts in from the left and slides a pass wide right for Bendtner, who floats a chip back into the centre. Randolph rises and plucks the ball from the sky on his goalline. 74 min: Ireland make their first change: Murphy, dripping with sweat after putting in a shift, is replaced by Shane Long. 72 min: The home fans make some noise here, though, as Sisto is replaced for the popular Nicklas Bendtner. 71 min: A couple more minutes of sterile Danish possession. The Copenhagen crowd is getting a little restless. 69 min: Poulsen shifts the ball between his feet and drops a shoulder, making space down the inside-right channel. He tries to guide a shot into the bottom left. Inches wide of the post. Randolph was slightly wrong-footed and while he probably had the shot covered, it would have been pretty close. 68 min: Ireland continue to pin Denmark back, without particularly turning the screw. Time ticks on, which is good enough news for O’Neill’s side. 67 min: Poulsen’s first act is to accidentally crump an elbow in Arter’s coupon. Brady loops the free kick into a crowded box. Neither Kjaer nor Bjelland manage to make a clearing header, and the ball drops to Clark, eight feet out and clear! But the big defender can’t quite adjust his body to sidefoot goalwards. Bjelland is able to clear at the second opportunity. 66 min: Delaney attempts a drive from the best part of 35 yards. It’s fair to say Denmark are getting a little bit frustrated by Ireland’s staunch defending. 64 min: Cornelius is replaced by Yussuf Poulsen. 62 min: Eriksen earns another corner down the right. Denmark are beginning to apply a bit of pressure again. But not too much: once again the set piece is a non-event. 60 min: The ball deflected out for a corner; the set piece comes to nothing. 59 min: Eriksen whips a cross into the Irish box from the right. It hits Arter on the back of his arm as the Ireland midfielder turned his back; the pair were very close together. Eriksen claims a handball, and a penalty, but he frantically looks around, and can’t find Ovidiu Hategan anywhere. It would have been as daft a decision as the one which befell Northern Ireland the other night, and match official Milorad Mazic isn’t having a bar of it. 58 min: A little bit of head tennis in the Danish box. The hosts eventually clear, but only because O’Dowda doesn’t connect with a header while hovering on the right-hand edge of the six-yard box. 57 min: Sisto nips down the right, jinking this way and that, finally sending a teasing dink into the box. But there are no red shirts attacking the ball, and Christie can cushion a header back to Randolph. 56 min: A free kick for Ireland out on the Irish left, near the halfway line. Ward sprays a diagonal one for Duffy, rising in the Danish area on the right. He barges his man to the floor and that’s a free kick to Denmark, the pressure released. 54 min: This is extremely scrappy. Ireland won’t mind a bit. They’ve quietened the crowd, and there’s a palpable tension in the air. Denmark can’t get going at all right now. Ireland are struggling for coherence too, but it’s not their gaff, it’s not up to them. 52 min: Aye, it’s been a quiet start to the half. 50 min: McClean goes bowling down the left and very nearly powers past Ankersen, but he’s tight on the touchline and the ball squirts out of play. It’s a quiet start to the half. 48 min: Denmark are immediately on the front foot again, the break having put a stop to Ireland’s growing momentum. A big hoick forward. Delaney goes up with Clark, but doesn’t get a header goalwards. And we’re off again! No changes at half time. Denmark get the ball rolling in their lovely red shirts. “Sure,” says Kat Petersen, “but the font on the back is an absolute abomination.” Indeed. To the point that comic sans would be an improvement. Half-time advertisement: And that’s that for the opening 45. Denmark the better side for most of it, but Ireland were on top during the final exchanges of the half. On another day, both sides would have scored. As it is ... nothing yet. Ireland will be perfectly happy with that. So far, so good for Martin O’Neill’s men! 44 min: The set piece comes to nothing. Oh my, Christie really should have scored there. But what a marvellous run; that will give him encouragement for the rest of this tie, because he had Larsen on toast there. 43 min: Christie knocks the ball past Larsen down the right, and backs himself in a footrace. He burns past the full back and is free in the box! He faces Schmeichel from a tight angle, and attempts the chip. He should have blootered it. The ball breaks back to Hendrick, who drops a shoulder to make space. But not enough space: his shot is blocked out for a corner. 40 min: Eriksen dances down the middle of the park, his toes twinkling. Lovely. He then pings the ball to his left, in the hope of releasing Sisto into the area. Sisto takes his eye off the ball, luckily for Ireland, because he’d have been clear otherwise. 38 min: Good work by McClean down the left. He reaches the byline and pulls back for O’Dowda, who can’t get a shot away from the edge of the box. For a split second, it looked as though Denmark had been opened up, but the door slammed shut again. 37 min: Some sterile Denmark possession, Ireland holding their shape. Then, down the right, Ankersen attempts to replicate this goal: He doesn’t manage it, the ball flying over the bar. Still, full marks for ambition. 34 min: Another free kick for Ireland in the midfield, another chance to load the box. Brady loops it in. Duffy goes up with Schmeichel but the big keeper is always going to win. 32 min: So having said that, Ireland give up a huge chance. Sorry. Schmeichel hacks a clearance up the middle. Clark tries to hoof it back upfield, but only succeeds in cushioning a pass to Eriksen, suddenly in acres of space 30 yards from goal. He sends a swerver towards the top left. Randolph parries. Jorgensen can’t latch onto the rebound, but Sisto, coming in from the left, has to score, the net unguarded. But he slaps his shot across the face of goal and wide right. A dreadful miss. Denmark should be leading. 31 min: Cornelius attempts to bust down the right wing. But McClean isn’t having it, and holds him off in the powerful style. Eventually an irritated Cornelius concedes a free kick in the tussle. Ireland are looking resolute in defence, as they always do. 29 min: Eriksen, Cornelius and Jorgensen play clever little balls to each other down the middle of the park. It’s like a rolling maul, and very nearly opens Ireland up. But the final pass, intended for Sisto down the inside left, is blocked by Duffy. 28 min: Ankersen does extremely well to keep a wild pass down the Danish right in play. He feeds Sisto, who nearly dribbles his way into a shooting position down the inside right. He’s forced to turn back and lay off to Jorgensen, who tries his luck from 25 yards. It’s a lame curler towards the bottom left, and always heading wide. 26 min: McClean makes off down the left, on the road to nowhere. He’s foolishly upended by Kvist. A free kick in a dangerous position. And a chance for Ireland to load the box once again. Arter and Brady stand over the free kick. Brady whips it in. It’s a dreadful delivery, flat and easily intercepted by the first red shirt it comes near. A chance to trouble Schmeichel for the first time is spurned. 24 min: Kvist, on the right-hand edge of the Irish box, hooks into the mixer. Jorgensen is lurking, forcing Clark to head over at the expense of a corner. Sisto takes the world’s worst set piece, battering it straight into Ward, standing close by. The danger is over. 22 min: Eriksen shifts his feet 20 yards from goal and carves out just enough space for a snapshot. His effort flies straight at Randolph, who swallows it up. 20 min: The free kick is tapped to Arter, who floats a ball towards Duffy on the right-hand edge of the Danish area. The ball clips off Duffy’s eyebrows and out of play. It’s fair to say we’ve seen nothing of Ireland as a creative force yet, but then the onus isn’t on them. 19 min: Kjaer barges into the back of Murphy in the centre circle. A free kick, and an awful lot of whistling. All of a sudden, Ireland are doing a good job of irritating their hosts. 17 min: A little bit of sweet possession for Ireland. There’s no real intent to pile forward; they’re just trying to get a foothold in this game. In that respect, it’s been a positive couple of minutes. The crowd lose a little of their voice accordingly. 15 min: Now Ireland get another throw. Christie flings it towards Duffy, but there’s no goalward header forthcoming and Larsen hacks clear. 13 min: More of the Danish dominance. They earn a throw deep down the left. It’s fizzed into the feet of Sisto, who can’t control and the ball flies out of play for a goal kick. Ireland will be thankful for the relief; they’ve been getting pressed back. 11 min: What a double save by Randolph! Kjaer, deep on the right, sprays a diagonal pass towards Larsen on the left. Larsen takes a touch and creams a fierce shot from a tight angle. Randolph parries, it’s all he can do. The ball breaks to Cornelius, who slams goalwards from eight yards. He must score. But it’s straight at the keeper, and the ball sticks to his body! Ireland survive! 10 min: It’s not been too free flowing. A lot of pinball nonsense in the middle, though Denmark mostly have control of the flippers. 8 min: Christie throws long into the Danish box from the right. Clark shoves Larsen, and there goes that little bit of Irish pressure. The visitors weren’t afraid to load the box, it should be noted. 6 min: Eriksen drops deep and begins to prompt. He nearly one-twos with Jorgensen on the edge of the Irish box, but the striker’s flick doesn’t quite come off. He then tries a powerful bustle down the left channel, but that comes to nothing. He looks in the mood. 5 min: Denmark are still enjoying the lion’s share, though it’s all a bit frantic in the middle of the park. Here’s Paul Doyle again: “Ten Irish players came into this game on a yellow, eight of whom are starting. In the 1997 playoff v Belgium, 11 Irish players went into the first leg on a suspension and eight started. None got booked. It ended 1-1 v Belgium ... and, er, we lost the second leg.” For the record, only Brady, O’Dowda and Hendrick can afford to pick up a booking for Ireland tonight. Everyone else starting in white would miss Dublin on Tuesday. 3 min: Kvist clips a cross into the Irish area from the right. Jorgensen very nearly plants his head on the ball at the far post, but Christie does enough to nix the goalscoring plan. But the home side are on the front foot in these early minutes, with Ireland pushed back. Pretty much as expected. And we’re off! Ireland get the ball rolling, and win an early free kick in the midfield. Duffy pumps it long, into the Danish box. Cornelius clears. Hearty whoops and cheers soundtrack it all. The teams are out! Denmark are in their very lovely red Hummel shirts, a pretty arrows-on-shoulder design ... though it’s never going to be as good as the one sported by Sepp Piontek’s side in 1986, is it, it just can’t be. Ireland meanwhile sport their gorgeous second-choice white. The anthems blare out; tension crackles in the air, along with some red and white fireworks. Danish dynamite! Both sets of fans are giving it plenty. A place in the finals is within touching distance, after all. We’ll be off in a minute! The pre-match platitudes of Martin O’Neill, who clearly cannot be bothered one jot with the interview, and let’s be honest, who can blame him: “We need to stay in the game. We need to try to score a goal if we can. Easier said than done. A big night!” Dispatch from Danmark: “Pleased to see O’Dowda starting, a most encouraging inclusion,” writes our man Paul Doyle. “Looks like O’Neill wasn’t bluffing when he talked about ‘going for it’. Also, the first Ireland player ever to score against Denmark was Dermot Curtis in a 2-1 win in 1956. That earned him a move from Shelbourne to Bristol City, now home to O’Dowda. I’m taking that as an omen.” Required pre-match reading #2: A classic, this. As entertaining as the team it celebrates. Just in case you missed this wonderful book at the time, it’s never too late to get on it ... Required pre-match reading #1: Paul Doyle’s over in Copenhagen, and there’s a man who knows what’s what. Don’t make his trip wasted. The 22-year-old Bristol City winger Callum O’Dowda is the only addition to the XI sent out to beat Wales in Cardiff last month. He replaces the suspended David Meyler. Denmark coach Age Hareide - an old pal of Martin O’Neill’s from their Manchester City days in the early Eighties - makes five changes to the side which drew 1-1 with Romania. Peter Ankersen, Andreas Bjelland, Jens Stryger Larsen, Andreas Cornelius and Nicolai Jorgensen all step up; Riza Durmisi, Andreas Christensen, Nicklas Bendtner, Henrik Dalsgaard and Yussuf Poulsen make way. Denmark: Schmeichel, Ankersen, Kjaer, Bjelland, Stryger Larsen, Delaney, Kvist, Eriksen, Cornelius, Jorgensen, Sisto. Subs: Lossl, Hansen, Jensen, Vestergaard, Christensen, Bendtner, Jorgensen, Kundsen, Fischer, Lerager, Schone, Poulsen. Republic of Ireland: Randolph, Christie, Duffy, Clark, Ward, O’Dowda, Arter, Brady, Hendrick, McClean, Murphy. Subs: Westwood, Elliot, O’Shea, McShane, Whelan, McGeady, S Long, Hoolahan, Hourihane, Doherty, Hogan, K Long. Referee: Milorad Mazic (Serbia). In a parallel universe – one where Jesper Olsen never played that square pass, and Roy Keane and Mick McCarthy were the sort to bite their tongues and muddle through – this is a match-up between two erstwhile World Cup winning nations. Sadly, in the cosmos we do inhabit, 1986 and 2002 are filed under Glorious Missed Opportunities instead. One of these great footballing countries will have a chance to right that wrong next summer in Russia. But only one. Denmark are 19th in the Fifa rankings, six places above the Republic of Ireland, so go into this two-legged World Cup qualification play-off as favourites. Christian Eriksen of Tottenham Hotspur is the man who usually brings home the bacon for the Danes; he’s scored in seven of their ten qualifiers so far. Ireland boss Martin O’Neill has the midfielder pegged in a world-class bracket alongside the likes of Gareth Bale, Eden Hazard, Luis Suarez and Neymar. It’s going to be a big test for the Irish in Copenhagen tonight. But they’ll be up for it; O’Neill’s men always are. Denmark might have lost just one of their last home matches, but Ireland are a steely proposition on the road: they’re six unbeaten on their travels. Their last trip, away to a Bale-free Wales, ended in the win which earned them a place in this play-off. They boast no stars of the world stage – the most creative member of their squad is a 35-year-old from Norwich City who probably won’t start – but then that’s not really the point. Time and again, Ireland prove beyond doubt that they’re a team, one much greater than the sum of its parts. Both sides will be dreaming of Russia, and legitimately so. Will Denmark take a big step towards their first finals since 2010? Or will Ireland set themselves up for glory back in Dublin on Tuesday night, in their quest to reach the World Cup for the first time since that mind-bending summer 15 years ago? We’ll soon find out ... because this, ladies and gentlemen, is on! Kick off: 7.45pm GMT, 8.45pm in Copenhagen.",

        "bodyText": "It says something about how capitalism works within our political system that in the week in which the Paradise Papers revealed the ways companies use tax havens and complex accounting methods to avoid paying tax, the government has again been pushing its case for a cut in the company tax rate. The Paradise Papers, with its trove of information on how companies shuffle money around the planet in order to reduce their tax liabilities, highlight just how warped the economic system has become. The system in which we operate is one where the impetus is always towards lowering taxation for companies, and which is partly justified on the basis that doing so will reduce the incentive for companies to engage in the kinds of tax minimisation practices revealed in the Paradise Papers. And thus we have a race to the bottom in order to make ourselves attractive to companies who will continue, regardless of our tax rate, to shuffle money around the globe so as to reduce their tax obligations. The race to the bottom was given some theoretical heft this week from a paper by three economists within the Treasury department which suggested that, were the US to cut its tax rate by the amount Donald Trump hopes – from 35% to 20% – then we would likely need to follow suit or face lower GDP growth and lower real wages. But, for a paper that focussed on the impact of the US tax policy, the reporting was rather curious. The Australian ran it on its front page as an exclusive and pushed the line that the research revealed “the full rollout of the Turnbull government’s company tax plan will deliver a $30bn revenue return to the federal budget.” This was a rather curious lead given the report did not actually provide any such new information. What it did was repeat a line from another widely reported Treasury research paper written in May last year : “the total revenue loss from the company tax cut that is recovered in the long run through second-round effects is estimated to be around 45 cents per dollar of net company tax cut with 8 cents accruing to sub-national governments and 37 cents to the federal government”. We’re in a pretty weird place where a line repeated from research written 18 months ago is now held up as new information deserving of a front-page headline. And we’re in an even more weird place when the suggestion that 37 cents of every dollar lost in revenue returning to the federal government is “effectively halving the claimed total cost of the policy.” Thirty seven percent of $65bn is just over $24bn, which is a bit short of the “$30bn boost for Turnbull’s tax reform plan” which the Australian chose as its front-page headline. The Treasury research suggested eight cents in the dollar would go to the states. It seems a bit of a stretch to claim that a potential $5bn in state revenue would reduce the cost to the federal government’s budget. It also says something about how warped the economic debate is in this country that the impact of policy which everyone agrees will cause revenue to fall is described as a “boost” because some research estimates net revenue will fall only $35bn, not $65bn. But the suggestion that this somehow means that the company tax cut will cost less than the previous estimate of $65.4bn – included in the Treasurer’s own statement made in parliament in May – is rather dopey. Firstly, the estimate of 45 cents in the dollar return has been known for a year and a half, and secondly, budget papers don’t include second-round impacts. You can’t say you will cut tax but then argue this will spur growth and thus the drop in revenue will not be as bad. The problem is such second-round impacts are based on a multitude of assumptions, any tweaks of which greatly change the outcomes. Budget numbers that worked like that would become meaningless very quickly as governments would see all sorts of theoretical benefits to accrue from their policies that would create magical revenue figures. At any rate, this new Treasury paper was not really about the cost of the plan, but more the impact of Donald Trump’s proposal to cut the company tax rate in the US from 35% to 20%. The paper suggests that if the US were to cut the company tax rate by that much, capital dollars would flow to the US from other nations (including Australia) and thus our GDP and wages would suffer as a result. There are a few problems with suggesting this is a reason to pass our own tax cuts. Firstly, it is hard enough to assume the economic impact of policy that might be implemented in Australia, let alone things that possibly will occur in the US. Given the corporate tax cut is not popular with US voters and unlikely to be feasible without massively increasing either the US deficit or taxes on individuals, it might be best to hold off on working out its impact until we see what legislation actually makes its way through Congress. And secondly, the whole suggestion that a company tax cut leads to greater investment and improved wages growth is something that always looks a lot better in the economic modelling than in reality. The UK, for example, has cut its company tax rate from 30% in 2007 to 19%, and yet real wages in the UK are lower now than they were in 2007. And while it is nice to believe that a lower rate will bring greater investment, the issue is always what kind of investment will be attracted by a lower rate. As the Reserve Bank assistant governor, Luci Ellis, explained to a parliamentary committee in February, we want to attract direct investment – i.e. companies setting up shop here – as that “builds new things, versus, say, purchasing of existing securities or purchasing of existing assets.” The Paradise Papers certainly show that companies and high-worth individuals like to purchase assets and securities in a manner to avoid paying tax, but it is less of an issue for direct investment, which instead looks at labour costs and skills, location of assets, infrastructure, incentives for research and development, and the whole regulatory system. We seem trapped in an debate in which, despite the benefits of an economy and political system which make us attractive to investors, it would appear as though all a country has going for it is its tax rate – a tax rate, which we have seen this week, is often avoided.",

        "bodyText": "Theresa May faces a devastating Commons defeat over Brexit within weeks if she continues to deny parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal with the EU, Tory and Labour MPs have warned. With the withdrawal bill returning to the Commons on Tuesday, a cross-party group who oppose a hard Brexit and are co-operating on tactics say they believe they have the numbers to defeat the government if they are denied such a vote. While the critical amendments and closest votes are not expected to be taken until next month, Tories who oppose a hard Brexit insist there is no softening of their position and that they are biding their time ready to strike before Christmas. Some Tories say they are even more determined to insist on parliament’s right to veto a bad or no deal because the prime minister appears not to have responded to any of their concerns over recent weeks. Instead, in what was seen by many as a provocative move, she announced last week that the government had tabled its own amendment that would commit the UK to formally leaving on 29 March 2019, whatever the outcome of negotiations and even if there were no deal. A Commons defeat for May over Brexit, at a time when her government is reeling from the loss of two cabinet ministers in six days – and may lose more – would raise further questions over her ability to survive as prime minister. Anna Soubry, a Tory rebel who strongly backs a veto for MPs, criticised May’s amendment as a sop to the anti-EU wing of the party. She said it had been “done to appease the hard Brexiteers and keep them on Theresa’s side”. She added: “It is not necessary and, indeed, will tie the government’s hands. I will need some persuading not to vote against it.” The cross-party group, which includes around a dozen Tory backbenchers and former Conservative ministers, has calculated privately that, if the expected number of pro-Brexit Labour MPs back the government, they will probably need 11 Conservative MPs to vote with them to inflict a defeat. One MP closely involved in the cross-party moves said: “We already have very close to that number and there could be more.” Another senior MP said Tories with seats in Scotland in which there had been strong support for Remain before the Brexit referendum were coming under heavy pressure from constituents to vote for any amendment that would prevent a hard Brexit. Ten Conservative MPs have put their name to an amendment, tabled by the Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve, which calls for the final withdrawal deal to be approved through a separate statute, which would mean MPs would get the vote they seek. Chuka Umunna, the Labour co-chair of the cross-party group on EU relations, said he believed enough Tory MPs would stand firm. “There is a Rubicon to be crossed – to put country before party and career – and I sense that more and more Conservatives are prepared to do it,” he said. “They believe they have been led up the garden path before and won’t make that mistake again. They will not be bullied by a prime minister who dances to the tune of the hard right in their party.” Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has accused May of ignoring concerns across all parties and in the country about the withdrawal bill. He said the government could be heading for defeat on up to 13 amendments tabled by Tory rebels. However, ministers offered no concessions on Friday and now face criticism from MPs across parliament during 16 hours of debate about the bill later this week. Starmer said: “Theresa May cannot keep ignoring the serious concerns Labour and her own MPs have about the withdrawal bill. The prime minister could have used the bill’s delay to rethink her approach and accept Labour’s reasonable and considered demands on what needs to change – in particular the wide use of Henry VIII powers, protections for workers’ rights and environmental standards, and ensuring strong transitional arrangements are in place when we leave the EU. “Instead, she has sought to marginalise parliament and come forward with amendments that are more about keeping her in power than ensuring Britain can negotiate a strong Brexit deal.” One of Labour’s demands is that “parliament, and not ministers, has the final say on whether to approve the withdrawal agreement and how best to implement it”. Writing in the Observer, Labour MP Seema Malhotra, a member of the all-party Brexit select committee, says she has tabled an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill defining the steps the government must take in the event of no deal being agreed, or of one not being approved by parliament by the end of February 2019. “Europe is planning for life post-Brexit while the UK is stuck in an unreality of its own making,” she says.",
