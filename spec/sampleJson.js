We havenâ€™t seen the Spanish coach in the A-League since his days in charge of Adelaide United - heady days indeed - and if youâ€™re a Wanderers fan, youâ€™re probably a bit excited. Heâ€™s said he wants to bring free-flowing, attacking football to Wanderers and takes over a team just waiting to make good on that promise. The form of Oriol Riera, Alvaro and Raul Llorente has been encouraging so far this season, even though their first win of the season only came last week. Still, theyâ€™re one of just three unbeaten sides and will fancy their chances of coming away from AAMI Park with something come 9 oâ€™clock tonight. City, who ceded top spot on the ladder with defeat to Sydney FC last week, will be looking to bounce back and get back in the winning column. Anyway, kick-off is nearly upon us, so stay tuned.

Players on the ground now. Yes, we know. But the Wellington game went overtime, and then the earlier game in this double-header - the W-League clash between Melbourne City and Newcastle - went overtime (will bring you more on Cityâ€™s 5-2 win shortly, but for those who saw it - how good was Fishlock? I caught her brilliant long-range goal on my dinner break!) A-League Melbourne City v WSW Some interesting stats for you as we wait for this game to get underway. None of the last 11 games between these teams has seen the same result in consecutive games, with the last fixture between these teams ending in a 3-1 victory to the Wanderers. Melbourne City have won three of their last four meetings with the Wanderers at AAMI Park, including each of the last two. 10 of the Wanderersâ€™ last 13 goals against Melbourne City have come in the second half. Melbourne City have scored three goals from outside the box this campaign, more than any other team. Bruce Kamau has a shot conversion rate of 60%, the best of any player to have attempted at least five shots this campaign. A-League teams Western Sydney Wanderers (4-2-3-1) Starting XI - Janjetovic (GK); Hamill, Cornthwaite, Thwaite, Llorente; Bonevacia, Kearyn Baccus; Kusukami, Bridge, Sotirio; Riera. Substitutions - Hall (GK), Cejudo, Santalab, Aspropotamitis, Keaunu Baccus. Melbourne City (4-2-3-1) Starting XI - Galekovic (GK); Muscat, La Rocca, Shenkeveld, Jamieson; Malik, Jakobsen; Kamau, Mauk, Fitzgerald; McCormack. Substitutions - Bouzanis (GK), Kilkenny, Carrusca, Brattan, Budzinski. A-League Melbourne City v Western Sydney Wanderers Now to the second part of the football double header at AAMI Park (following Melbourne City v Newcastle Jets in the W-League) and our feature match of the day: Melbourne City v Western Sydney Wanderers, the latter who are tonight officially, for the first time, under the stewardship of the returning Josep Gombau. We havenâ€™t seen the Spanish coach in the A-League since his days in charge of Adelaide United - heady days indeed - and if youâ€™re a Wanderers fan, youâ€™re probably a bit excited. Heâ€™s said he wants to bring free-flowing, attacking football to Wanderers and takes over a team just waiting to make good on that promise. The form of Oriol Riera, Alvaro and Raul Llorente has been encouraging so far this season, even though their first win of the season only came last week. Still, theyâ€™re one of just three unbeaten sides and will fancy their chances of coming away from AAMI Park with something come 9 oâ€™clock tonight. City, who ceded top spot on the ladder with defeat to Sydney FC last week, will be looking to bounce back and get back in the winning column. Anyway, kick-off is nearly upon us, so stay tuned. Should be a decent game. Iâ€™m back... sort of Just my luck, my monitor has died. So Iâ€™m here, with my tiny laptop screen. Iâ€™ve tried literally everything to fix it and it just isnâ€™t happening. Give me a few more minutes and then weâ€™ll get stuck into the A-League. Taking a break Alright, I need a dinner break, but Iâ€™ll be back later on to take you through the A-League match between Melbourne City and Western Sydney Wanderers, as well as W-League and RLWC results. Cheers! The Melbourne Boomers have flashed their WNBL championship credentials by knocking off three major contenders in the space of seven days. Slow out of the gates after injuries to key signings Jenna Oâ€™Hea and Louella Tomlinson, the Boomers are now clicking into gear with recent wins over Dandenong, Sydney Uni and a dramatic 77-74 victory against Adelaide on Sunday afternoon. Liz Cambage is back to her dominant best, averaging 29 points and nine rebounds in the past three games; including a 44-point, 12 rebound performance against the Lightning; with her presence in the paint creating open shots for her teammates. With thanks to AAP Both Fyfe and Betts miss very gettable goals at the death - which means the Australians donâ€™t quite close the game out as they should have. Zach Tuohy had a long-range shot at goal with a minute or so left, and chose to put the ball on the grass - going for a free-kick style soccer goal, but missed everything. As far as these tests go, this was a fairly one-sided contest. Nat Fyfe looked dangerous - and is unofficially â€˜best on groundâ€™ for the commentary team (Freo fans wouldâ€™ve loved every minute of this). Scott Pendlebury, meanwhile, has apparently re-injured his troublesome finger, which is awful news for Pies fans. Zorko is also getting some ice and strapping to the ribs at the conclusion. Just over 25,000 is the official crowd figure, apparently - lauded as â€˜impressiveâ€™ but Iâ€™d say pretty disappointing. Sounds as if average fans might have been priced out. A relatively fun affair from a viewing perspective - will you be tuning in for the second leg? Next stop for this series is Perth. International Q4 13:30 Australia 62-50 Ireland OK Iâ€™ve just cottoned on to the fact that Kade Simpson is sporting a â€˜moâ€™ - I was wondering why I hadnâ€™t recognised him despite the fact thatâ€™s had 39 disposals! Fyfe misses an easy over - to keep the Irish close enough to give them hope for the series overall. International Q4 10:30 Australia 58-44 Ireland Kade Simpson has had 35 disposals, Hibberd 31, and Zach Merrett 34 - of those Iâ€™d say Hibberd has had the biggest influence. Itâ€™s a tap in by Shuey for six! That might just do it for the Australians. Great set-up from Gunston, and the Irish goalkeeper stayed back - gifting Shuey the chance to â€˜dunkâ€™ a goal. Sloane then misses, failing to put Ireland away. Itâ€™s a â€˜cumulativeâ€™ series, so the margin here matters. Aka Ireland will want to stay close even if they lose. International rules Q4 05:30 Australia 51-44 Ireland Michael Murphy manages to open the account for the Irish in this final quarter - have been super impressed with his game. Think the Irish might have too much of a differential to claw back, but these games are fast-paced (and close) if nothing else. On cue, Conor McManus (nine scores from ten disposals!) scores a long-range over for his team, and things start to heat up again. Paul Geaney almost makes another long-range bomb for the Irish, but itâ€™s an impressive save from Goddard (impressive agility on display). Heâ€™s performed admirably in Fletcherâ€™s absence - the man I thought might never retire. Gaeney finally makes an over - and itâ€™s a seven-point game. W-League Thanks Blue, for your below the line live blogging on the W-League - I regret that todayâ€™s shift didnâ€™t work so that I could cover a game - but rest-assured I will be trying to do one ASAP! Iâ€™ll bring you results of Canberra United v Sydney FC and Melbourne City v Newcastle as soon as I can. Wellington Phoenix have recorded their first win of the A-League season, downing Perth Glory 5-2 in an entertaining and controversial match in Wellington on Sunday. The decisive blow in the thriller came in the 74th minute when the video assistant referee adjudged Glory defender Scott Neville had blocked Andrija Kaludjerovicâ€™s volley with a hand. The penalty was eventually awarded, Kaludjerovic converted and Wellington opened out a two-goal lead in the action-packed end-to-end match. Kaludjerovic extended the margin in the 87th minute, heading home Adam Parkhouseâ€™s cross to grab a brace and boost his tally to five goals for the season. The win over fifth-placed Perth finally shifts Wellington off the bottom of the ladder into eighth place, adding a much-needed three points to their two draws and three losses for the season. With thanks to AAP International rules three-quarter-time Australia 50-35 Ireland DrRudi tells me (below the line) that tickets for International Rules were $70 - really? Canâ€™t understand how they can be so expensive, especially given theyâ€™ve struggled to draw a decent crowd in Australia. Agree with you that publicity has been poor - and thereâ€™s no live stats either, which is disappointing for me! Get the impression Ireland care about this series more than Australia (or the AFL does). Is that fair? Meanwhile, on field, the Aussies have pulled away with an over to Paddy Ryder and ALMOST a six-pointer to Eddie Betts with a tap over the goalkeeper that was millimetres from crossing the line. Dangerfield then gets stuck into Chris Barrett (Irelandâ€™s number two) after he appears to trip him. Some feeling in this. International rules Q3 12:00 Australia 44-34 Ireland Fyfe! Possibly best on ground, he manages the first six-pointer for the Australians - heâ€™s pumped, and his teammates come from everywhere. You get the sense heâ€™s popular. The Australians have managed a 21-point turnaround, at 41-30, before the Irish hit back with an over and a behind. Speaking of hybrid naturals - Hibberd looks at ease, as does Dangerfield - as in the AFL, he looks to have all the time in the world. Alright, confirmation Joel Selwood isnâ€™t playing. Says heâ€™s struggled with less preparation than his teammates, and should be back for the next test. Meanwhile, Eddie Betts wins a contested mark and resultant over - and is clearly the favourite of this Adelaide crowd. International rules Q3 06:55 Australia 35-30 Ireland Speaking of Fyfe, here he is on the end of a nice pass from Shaun Burgoyne (who was the unexpected choice for captain in an Australian side heavy on leadership - Fyfe, Boak, Pendlebury and Selwood are the club captains named in the Australian side). To be honest with you, Iâ€™m not even sure Selwood is playing - if he is I havenâ€™t spotted him! Fyfe converts, but the Irish respond quickly with an over of their own. This game has settled into a score for score pattern. Shuey then hits the post - and some of the Aussies are slow to respond (probably not used to the rule that a poster is play on!) FYI you can also â€˜knock throughâ€™ a goal, unlike in AFL - meaning you can punch through a six-pointer. The latest over goes to Hibberd - who has had a mountain of possession. Just spotted Bec Goddard in the coachesâ€™ box. What a year for her! Canâ€™t wait to see what she can do with the defending AFLW champions, the Adelaide Crows. International rules Unfortunately there arenâ€™t a lot of pictures coming through from this contest - but hereâ€™s one of Adelaide star Eddie Betts, who was warming up prior to the game by dribbling the round ball between his legs, basketball style. Itâ€™s a tight contest so far - reflective of the tight nature of the series to date. Ireland have the edge over the Australians - having won 10 series to 9 (and 21 test matches to 17). The Irish have dominated in recent times, including in the most recent test in Ireland (Croke Park), where they triumphed 56-52. International Rules half-time Australia 28-27 Ireland A couple of overs to Nat Fyfe breathes some life into the Australians. So good to see the former Brownlow medallist running unrestricted. Scary stuff for those whoâ€™ll line up on him next season. Ross Lyon is also in attendance from the Fremantle football club, as the Australian defensive coach. Now the Australians hit the lead with a neat, round the body snap to Ben Brown. Heâ€™s made his way to Adelaide from Iceland (where I believe he was on his honeymoon!) to represent his country. FYI: I have been to Iceland, and it is, in my opinion, the most beautiful place on the planet. Letâ€™s just say I wouldnâ€™t be trading Iceland for Adelaide. International Rules Q2 10:30 Australia 17-27 Ireland A lovely goal to Dayne Zorko gets the Australians on the board in the second quarter, but itâ€™s soon matched by another McManus goal. Zorko looks the most â€˜naturalâ€™ of the Australians with the round ball, as our commentators have reminded us six, maybe seven times. Meanwhile Travis Boak and Zach Tuohy resume hostilities after Boak rode Tuohy into the ground as he tried to zip away deep in Brendon Goddardâ€™s defensive area. Looks to be a fairly disappointing crowd in Adelaide. From memory these games have only sold out twice in Australia - in Perth in 2003 and 2014. Irish leading in the kicking efficiency stakes - 71% to 54% - no surprises there. International Rules Q2 3:00 Australia 14-24 Ireland Michael Murphy again â€“ this time for the first â€˜goalâ€™ or six-pointer (soccer style) of the day. What do you think readers, do you enjoy a hybrid sport? What are the best examples out there, in your opinion? Ireland have hit the ground running in this second quarter - with a big, long curler to McManus (only he and Murphy have scored for the Irish - not that that has been a problem so far!) While weâ€™re taking a break here at Adelaide Oval, it looks like Melbourne United bounced back their heavy defeat to Cairns by running out 108-90 winners over Sydney. After being out-hustled in a big loss on Thursday night to the Taipans, United won the rebounding battle with the Kings and shared the scoring load for their fifth win of the season at Hisense Arena. â€œWe werenâ€™t happy about the way we lost the other night,â€ Melbourne coach Dean Vickerman said after his sideâ€™s much-improved effort against Sydney. â€œI thought there was a physicality that was really missing with our group so that was a priority tonight.â€ With thanks to AAP International Rules quarter-time Australia 14-15 Ireland For those wondering, this series owes its origin to the Australian Football World Tour, organised by sports broadcaster by former VFL umpire Harry Beitzel and Irish-born Melbournian, James Harkin in 1967 and 1968. This particular iteration - the International rules series - started in 1984, as a three-match format with the team who took the most wins/series points were crowned winners. However, things havenâ€™t always been smooth - there was a break in the series between 1990 and 1998 after lack of interest and poor Australian crowds (it returned in 1998 in a two-match aggregate format). In 2014, the series was reduced again to a one-off test match (with only All-Australian players in the green and gold) - to try to revive flagging interest. The tests were also indefinitely called off by the Gaelic Athletic Association in 2007 after a history of violent, on-field incidents (it then returned in October 2008, with new rules agreed upon by the two nations). I must admit that when I think of the International Rules series, I think of the â€˜biffâ€™. True to form, weâ€™ve already had some fracas today - with the Australians seemingly targetting the Irish No24 Aidan Oâ€™Shea. International Rules Q1 11:20 Australia 8-11 Ireland The Irish look the better of the two teams so far - have been impressed with the form of Michael Murphy â€“ a man who has purportedly knocked back many an offer to join the AFL. The Irish of course have the advantage of the round ball, while the Aussies have the advantage of the tackle. Speaking of, Goddard has started well, pushing up the ground and catching a few Irish forwards unawares. The first Australian over went to Chad Wingard - with a lovely checkside of the round ball. Dangerfield follows up with another, this time a low, floater. But itâ€™s Michael Murphy for his second over - heâ€™s dominating. Rory Sloane, on the bench, talks up the â€˜wonderfulâ€™ Adelaide weather, which I must say looks a little grey on the television. International Rules Q1 05:00 Australia 1-6 Ireland Youâ€™ll notice some familiar faces in the Irish side - Zach Tuohy is playing for his home country, as is Pearce Hanley. The first â€˜overâ€™ goes to Conor McManus (the second-most capped player in the series). He has apparently been looked at by Essendon, who have thought about recruiting him as an international rookie. This is something of a depleted Irish side - itâ€™s the first time since the â€˜formalâ€™ resumption of the series in 1984 that there will be no All-Ireland champions in the squad. The Irish follow up with another over to Michael Murphy (from a Goddard turnover), while Eddie Betts can only manage a point for the Australians. International rules - the rules Weâ€™re just about to get underway here, but for your benefit as much as mine, here are some key rules: There are 15 players on the field per team. There are no boundary throw-ins (whoever touches it last concedes a free-kick), and no shepherding allowed. Tackling, however, is permitted â€“ which is not something the Irish are used to (itâ€™s not part of their game!) If the ball hits the post, itâ€™s play on (unlike in AFL!) As for scoring, a behind = 1 point, â€˜overâ€™ = 3 points (through traditional AFL goal-posts) and â€˜goalâ€™ = 6 (through soccer-like goals). International rules - teams Here are your teams for this match - with plenty of star-power representing the Australian team.

Shane Walsh Welcome Hello everyone and welcome to this Sundayâ€™s edition of Sportwatch. Iâ€™m here to take you through todayâ€™s live action, whatever your preferred shape of ball. Todayâ€™s feature games are the International rules game one between Australia and Ireland, at Adelaide Oval, which is about to get underway. It will be interesting to see what the crowds are like for this one, given the hybrid gameâ€™s flagging interest in previous years. Then weâ€™ll have a minute-by-minute account of the Melbourne City v Western Sydney Wanderers A-League game at 7pm AEDT, which Iâ€™ll preview closer to. Iâ€™ll also endeavour to bring you the results of other A-League, W-League and Rugby League World Cup fixtures as we go. Donâ€™t forget weâ€™ve also got our womenâ€™s Ashes liveblog happening now, after Ellyse Perry stunned England with a maiden double century yesterday. Kate will be here shortly. In the meantime, read about Ellyse Perryâ€™s incredible, maiden double-century in the womenâ€™s Ashes yesterday.","charCount":"18630","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/12/sumie-lost-in-light-review-oddly-beautiful-buy-wilfully-wan","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-12T08:00:49Z","webTitle":"Sumie: Lost in Light review â€“ oddly beautiful but wilfully wan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/12/sumie-lost-in-light-review-oddly-beautiful-buy-wilfully-wan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/12/sumie-lost-in-light-review-oddly-beautiful-buy-wilfully-wan","fields":{"headline":"Sumie: Lost in Light review â€“ oddly beautiful but wilfully wan","standfirst":"<p>(Bella Union)</p>","trailText":"(Bella Union)","byline":"Emily Mackay","main":"<figure class='element element-image' data-media-id='7ad7bd5d32b4ea2cf5f0ffd7f493fb01cdb07a41'> <img src='https://media.guim.co.uk/7ad7bd5d32b4ea2cf5f0ffd7f493fb01cdb07a41/72_0_1848_1109/1000.jpg' alt='singer songwriter sumie standing in a frock in front of the sea and some scandinavian skerries' width='1000' height='600' class='gu-image' /> <figcaption> <span class='element-image__caption'>All washed outâ€¦ Sumie.</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Swedish singer-songwriter <a href='http://sumienagano.com/'>Sumie Nagano</a> (sister of <a href='http://little-dragon.net/'>Little Dragon</a> frontwoman Yukimi) seemingly paints only in watercolour.

Both are well made and danced, but raise serious questions about the company and the vision of its directors.</p> <p>The opening piece is Twyla Tharpâ€™s <strong>The Illustrated â€œFarewellâ€</strong>. Set to Haydnâ€™s Symphony No 45 (known as the â€œFarewellâ€), itâ€™s an expansion of Tharpâ€™s abstract work <a href='https://www.twylatharp.org/works/time-goes'><em>As Time Goes By</em></a>, choreographed in 1973 to part of the same symphony. Most of the new material is danced by Steven McRae and Sarah Lamb, and they hit every beat, delivering Tharpâ€™s jazzy shoulder rolls, foxy footwork and rubato phrasing as if to the manner born. The ensemble, led by Mayara Magri and Joseph Sissens, are fluency itself.</p> <aside class='element element-rich-link element--thumbnail'> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href='https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/02/twyla-tharp-interview-royal-ballet-opera-house'>Dance legend Twyla Tharp on truculent men, selling hot dogs and her idol Agatha Christie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the piece is formally rigorous, itâ€™s also dated, over-elaborate and a bit camp.

Elsewhere in the British arts establishment, the question of female agency in performance is a live topic. At Covent Garden, itâ€™s not even a conversation. Which is why, presumably, the Royal commissioned Arthur Pitaâ€™s <a href='http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/the-wind-by-arthur-pita'><strong>The Wind</strong></a>, a ballet whose pivotal event is another violent rape.</p> <p>Pita is a terrific choreographer, and in many respects this is a terrific ballet. Based on Dorothy Scarboroughâ€™s 1925 novel of the same name, <em>The Wind</em> tells the story of Letty Mason (Natalia Osipova), who arrives at a remote pioneer settlement in Texas. Appalled by the desolation of the place, she is driven to distraction by the unceasing wind. To survive, she marries a cowboy (Thiago Soares), and in his absence is preyed upon by a brutal cattle buyer (Thomas Whitehead), whom she shoots dead.</p>  <figure class='element element-image element--showcase' data-media-id='f33877481c319c21e4f04618ea27c906fd9dfb7a'> <img src='https://media.guim.co.uk/f33877481c319c21e4f04618ea27c906fd9dfb7a/0_0_4949_2880/1000.jpg' alt='Natalia Osipova and Thiago Soares in The Wind.' width='1000' height='582' class='gu-image' /> <figcaption> <span class='element-image__caption'>Natalia Osipova and Thiago Soares in The Wind.</span> <span class='element-image__credit'>Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Frank Moonâ€™s score is atmospheric, and Jeremy Herbertâ€™s set, which incorporates wind machines resembling antiquated farm machinery, is suitably bleak. Yann Seabraâ€™s costumes, meanwhile (gunbelts and duster coats for the men, big hats and weather-bleached ruffles for the women) are splendidly evocative. Pita deploys a low-slung choreographic style whose narrow range echoes the grim constraints of the location, and our first sight of the full cast, silhouetted against a parchment sky, is a real <em>coup de thÃ©Ã¢tre</em>. Soaresâ€™s taciturn cowboy is subtly drawn, Whitehead is terrifying, and Osipova is mesmerising as Letty, stamping out neurotic little bourrÃ©es on pointe as her hold on reality unravels.</p> <aside class='element element-rich-link element--thumbnail'> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href='https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/29/the-judas-tree-kenneth-macmillan-royal-ballet-observer-review'>The Judas Tree review â€“ genius marred by misogyny</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite these performances, the ballet feels rushed and foreshortened, as if thereâ€™s a central chapter missing. Then thereâ€™s the rape, which in a kind of ghastly continuity follows hard on the heels of the rape in <em>The Judas Tree</em>, which closed just five days earlier. Not that this is Pitaâ€™s fault.

Both are well made and danced, but raise serious questions about the company and the vision of its directors. The opening piece is Twyla Tharpâ€™s The Illustrated â€œFarewellâ€. Set to Haydnâ€™s Symphony No 45 (known as the â€œFarewellâ€), itâ€™s an expansion of Tharpâ€™s abstract work As Time Goes By, choreographed in 1973 to part of the same symphony. Most of the new material is danced by Steven McRae and Sarah Lamb, and they hit every beat, delivering Tharpâ€™s jazzy shoulder rolls, foxy footwork and rubato phrasing as if to the manner born. The ensemble, led by Mayara Magri and Joseph Sissens, are fluency itself. If the piece is formally rigorous, itâ€™s also dated, over-elaborate and a bit camp. Even as I admired the dancing, I didnâ€™t believe a bar of it, and Chester Weinbergâ€™s costumes donâ€™t help. Men in micro-shorts with twee little belts, darting yearning glances at women in mid-calf chiffons. Why, in 2017, is neo-classical dance still so fixated on such a coy, infantilising paradigm? There is an increasingly acute issue surrounding womenâ€™s roles in ballet. In the last few seasons the Royal Ballet stage has seen record numbers of female characters brutalised and killed. Emily, Mary Jane, and Little Dot eviscerated in Sweet Violets, Justine hanged and Elizabeth murdered in Frankenstein, Stephanie raped and Mary shot in Mayerling, the girl raped in The Invitation, the youngest sister hanged in Las Hermanas, and the woman raped and murdered in The Judas Tree. Consider this body-count alongside the number of recent abstract works in which women are split, splayed and otherwise manhandled, and certain embedded attitudes reveal themselves. None of these works, in which female characters are defined by their passivity and victimhood, was created by a woman. Elsewhere in the British arts establishment, the question of female agency in performance is a live topic. At Covent Garden, itâ€™s not even a conversation. Which is why, presumably, the Royal commissioned Arthur Pitaâ€™s The Wind, a ballet whose pivotal event is another violent rape. Pita is a terrific choreographer, and in many respects this is a terrific ballet. Based on Dorothy Scarboroughâ€™s 1925 novel of the same name, The Wind tells the story of Letty Mason (Natalia Osipova), who arrives at a remote pioneer settlement in Texas. Appalled by the desolation of the place, she is driven to distraction by the unceasing wind. To survive, she marries a cowboy (Thiago Soares), and in his absence is preyed upon by a brutal cattle buyer (Thomas Whitehead), whom she shoots dead. Frank Moonâ€™s score is atmospheric, and Jeremy Herbertâ€™s set, which incorporates wind machines resembling antiquated farm machinery, is suitably bleak. Yann Seabraâ€™s costumes, meanwhile (gunbelts and duster coats for the men, big hats and weather-bleached ruffles for the women) are splendidly evocative. Pita deploys a low-slung choreographic style whose narrow range echoes the grim constraints of the location, and our first sight of the full cast, silhouetted against a parchment sky, is a real coup de thÃ©Ã¢tre. Soaresâ€™s taciturn cowboy is subtly drawn, Whitehead is terrifying, and Osipova is mesmerising as Letty, stamping out neurotic little bourrÃ©es on pointe as her hold on reality unravels. Despite these performances, the ballet feels rushed and foreshortened, as if thereâ€™s a central chapter missing. Then thereâ€™s the rape, which in a kind of ghastly continuity follows hard on the heels of the rape in The Judas Tree, which closed just five days earlier. Not that this is Pitaâ€™s fault. No subject should be off-limits to an artist, rape included, and Pita tells his story as he sees it. Itâ€™s the Royalâ€™s commissioning process that needs examining. If the company is sincere in its desire to attract new audiences, it needs to better understand the times in which it lives. Perhaps this isnâ€™t the moment in history to present yet another ballet in which a woman is the object of sexual violence simply because she is a woman.

If you passed him on the street you probably wouldnâ€™t notice anything about him beyond his limp. But 35 years ago he yomped across the Falkland Islands and ran through a minefield under artillery fire on Mount Harriet. His section killed several Argentinians in a bloody battle and Armour found himself attending to a fatally wounded Argentinian soldier who spoke to him in English about visiting Oxford. He watched as the young man died.</p> <p>Gabriel Sagastume is a grey-haired lawyer with sleepy eyes and an easy smile. He was an Argentinian conscript during the Falklands war and was positioned on Wireless Ridge. His unit was short of food and so several of them waded across a river to a nearby house to raid its kitchen. When they came back they were blown up by a mine, planted by the Argentinian army. It was Sagastumeâ€™s job to collect the body parts and put them in his blanket.</p> <p>These sobering anecdotes are recounted in <em>Minefield</em>, a fascinating piece of documentary theatre about the Falklands war and its aftermath. It features six veterans, three from each side of the conflict, and was devised by the Argentinian artist and writer Lola Arias. Itâ€™s currently touring the country, having already been across Europe.</p> <p>After the two Iraq wars, the Afghan conflict and various military involvements in Bosnia, Kosovo, Libya and Syria, the Falklands war has disappeared into history. It was always a strange and incredible conflict, famously summarised by the great Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges as â€œtwo bald men fighting over a combâ€.</p> <p>Until they were invaded by Argentinian forces on 2 April 1982, the Falkland Islands did not loom large in the nationâ€™s consciousness. Most Britons would have been hard-pressed to locate them on a map.</p>  <figure class='element element-image' data-media-id='ca1ee3a3c7fd5fbc6a0675f8d90a8f57a734c90b'> <img src='https://media.guim.co.uk/ca1ee3a3c7fd5fbc6a0675f8d90a8f57a734c90b/0_575_4601_2761/1000.jpg' alt='Marcelo Vallejo and Lou Armour in Minefield.' width='1000' height='600' class='gu-image' /> <figcaption> <span class='element-image__caption'>Marcelo Vallejo and Lou Armour in Minefield.</span> <span class='element-image__credit'>Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These windswept outcrops 300 miles off the Argentinian coast were home to fewer than 2,000 people back then. Yet in the battle for them 907 people lost their lives and almost 2,000 more were injured, some very seriously.</p> <p>The invaders were defeated by the British task force sent by the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. The victory hugely boosted her flagging popularity and led to the downfall of the military junta in control of Argentina.</p> <p>These are the events that form the backdrop to <em>Minefield</em>, but itâ€™s not a play that explores the rights and wrongs of that conflict or, indeed, any other. What it does is look at the human experience of war and in particular what happens to those who go through it when they return to â€œnormalâ€ life.</p> <p>The Falklands war was one of the shortest in British military history, lasting just 74 days. But its effects on participants have continued for decades. Thereâ€™s a line in the play that says the rehearsals for the show went on longer than the conflict. And for Armour those rehearsals, in Buenos Aires, were a difficult process that led to him consulting a therapist for the first time in his life.</p> <p>Armourâ€™s mother died when he was a year old, and he was brought up in a foster family he hated. He joined the Royal Marines at 16. They became his family. He was part of a Royal Marine detachment that was on the island when the ArgentiniansÂ invaded. He and 50 or so other marines tried to defend Port Stanley, the capital, but were overpowered by much larger numbers and surrendered. They were sent back to the UK.</p>  <figure class='element element-image' data-media-id='93e099e22028ed8138cbc03ef7092339a1b19edb'> <img src='https://media.guim.co.uk/93e099e22028ed8138cbc03ef7092339a1b19edb/0_228_4100_2460/1000.jpg' alt='Royal Marines on board HMS Hermes as it sailed toward the Falklands as the flagship of the British task force.' width='1000' height='600' class='gu-image' /> <figcaption> <span class='element-image__caption'>Royal Marines on board HMS Hermes as it sailed toward the Falklands as the flagship of the British task force.</span> <span class='element-image__credit'>Photograph: Martin Cleaver/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Armour was asked if he wanted to return with the task force. He immediately said yes, but is that a decision heâ€™s ever regretted?</p> <p>â€œNo,â€ he says. â€œI was a young section commander at the time. The idea of my section going back and me not being there to lead them, whatever came, was total anathema toÂ me.â€</p> <p>In military terms, it was by no means a straightforward mission. The task force took six weeks to sail to the South Atlantic. Along the way, recalls David Jackson, a tall, ramrod-straight former Royal Marine and now a practising psychologist, the soldiers were briefed on what awaited them. Jackson says in the play that he was told: â€œWe are expecting one in three to be killed in initial landings.â€</p> <p>Despite this grim prediction, the marines stuck to their training schedule and held impromptu disco parties on board ship in the evenings. Routine suppressed fear and doubt â€“ until the real fighting began.</p> <p>The Falklands war was unlike many modern wars. Yes, there were fighter jets and Exocet missiles and lots of other impressive weapons of destruction. But most of the fighting was like something out of the first world war, with one force dug into its positions and the other seeking to oust them. There were plenty of close-contact battles, sometimes hand-to-hand combat. The initial landings were not as lethal as Jackson had been told to expect. Nonetheless if the war was short, it was also brutal and nasty.</p> <p>Aside from all the casualties on the islands, there was another in Argentina â€“ the military government. Headed by General Galtieri, it had stoked up nationalist fervour, portraying the invasion of the Malvinas, as the islands are known in Argentina, as a great patriotic liberation of an imperially occupied part of the motherland.</p>  <figure class='element element-image' data-media-id='6e6478a496ba9b4843bf93c50a01c8c56c935907'> <img src='https://media.guim.co.uk/6e6478a496ba9b4843bf93c50a01c8c56c935907/0_142_5127_3076/1000.jpg' alt='Falklands veterans Marcelo Vallejo and David Jackson, centre, face to face in Minefield.' width='1000' height='600' class='gu-image' /> <figcaption> <span class='element-image__caption'>Falklands veterans Marcelo Vallejo and David Jackson, centre, face to face in Minefield.</span> <span class='element-image__credit'>Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Galtieri promised that the British would be defeated and taught a lesson. When that didnâ€™t happen, his government lost its last remnants of credibility. For several years, the dictatorship had suppressed opposition with a ruthless campaign of violence, torture and murder in what was known as the dirty war. Many opponents were â€œdisappearedâ€, either into secret jails or, often, dumped into the Atlantic.</p> <p>One of the questions I ask the Argentinian members of the cast when we meet at the Royal Court theatre in London is whether it was worth losing the war to get that outcome. â€œItâ€™s a fact,â€ says Sagastume, â€œthat the dictatorship fell because of the war. Even in Argentina where we discuss politics all the time, this is not something everyone believes in. In my opinion, from an institutional point of view there was nothing else fighting the dictatorship. There were women walking around asking for their kidnapped children, but no big demonstrations. It was the war that really ended the junta. There was big support for the war among the people. And when the war was ended, they were ashamed that they supported the war in the beginning.â€</p> <p>There are in a political sense two ways of viewing the war that remain at the centre of ongoing debates about international conflict. From one perspective it was an imperial endeavour, a jingoistic effort to defend the union jack in a far-off place about which few Britons knew or cared. Another argument is that it was a fight against fascism and in favour of democracy. After all, the Falkland Islanders themselves wanted to remain under British jurisdiction.

At least during the course of the war. Afterwards survival became a mental issue, and one that may have been made more difficult for the British soldiers by how obscure and absurd the war seemed to many of their fellow citizens, and for the Argentinian soldiers by the fact that, although it meant a lot to the Argentinians, they were defeated.</p> <p>â€œMany people now donâ€™t even know that we fought in the Falklands war,â€ says Jackson. â€œItâ€™s not in peopleâ€™s consciousness.â€</p> <p>But it remains in his mind. When he came back to the UK, he felt alienated in the company of civilians. He found himself crying alongside a veteran Spitfire pilot at a party held to celebrate his return. Although his non-military friends were often well meaning, he struggled to relate to them.</p> <p>â€œIn some ways I was lucky,â€ says Jackson, â€œbecause I then focused on my relationship with my first wife, whoâ€™d been having an affair when I was down in the Falklands. The war became nothing compared to that.â€</p> <p>But he began to suffer from post-traumatic stress, depression, anxiety. In the play he says that he was particularly angry because more Falklands veterans had committed suicide than were killed during the war. This has been a widely accepted fact, but in 2013 a Ministry of Defence statistical study found that the suicide rate among veterans was no different to the general population. What did he think of theÂ report?</p> <p>â€œI donâ€™t buy that report, based on anecdotal evidence. But anecdotal evidence doesnâ€™t make research papers. Itâ€™s a contentious issue and Iâ€™ve sort of let that go now. To me now, one suicide is too many from any war.â€</p> <p><em>Minefieldâ€™s </em>Marcello Vallejo, who was a private working with heavy mortars in the Falklands, made a drunken suicide bid of sorts in 2002. He was on antidepressants and he threw himself into a reservoir unable to swim. Some fellow veterans managed to pull him out. Two years previously, after a long period of alcohol and cocaine abuse, he had been sent to a military hospital, following a breakdown. He stayed for three months and painted an image of Mount William, the Falklands landmark on which he fought. His close friend Sergio Azcarate had been blown up and killed beside him.</p> <p>â€œI didnâ€™t realise I was sick,â€ says Vallejo. â€œI was just feeling that no one understood. Everything brought me back to the war. Iâ€™d feel furious.â€</p>  <figure class='element element-image' data-media-id='724638d01404480f2dd7623d6c30c263d7f2efba'> <img src='https://media.guim.co.uk/724638d01404480f2dd7623d6c30c263d7f2efba/0_653_4445_2667/1000.jpg' alt='Vallejo, Armour, Otero, Sagastume and Jackson strike up a tune for Minefield.' width='1000' height='600' class='gu-image' /> <figcaption> <span class='element-image__caption'>Vallejo, Armour, Otero, Sagastume and Jackson strike up a tune for Minefield.</span> <span class='element-image__credit'>Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After his failed drowning, he decided to learn how to swim. It was a turning point, he says, the beginning of a very slow change. Subsequently heâ€™s become a competitor in triathlons. On stage he appears in his sports gear, a lean, saturnine figure with a hauntingÂ presence.</p> <p>The play offers a forum in which these stories of pain and loss can be told, but itâ€™s not a glum-fest at all. Far from it. One of the uplifting aspects of the performance is the use of music.</p> <p>Ruben Otero was on the General Belgrano, the Argentinian cruiser that was sunk by the British outside the 200-mile exclusion zone, an act that made certain that there would be no last-minute peace agreement. He was 19 at the time and he spent 41 hours at sea on a lifeboat.</p> <p>Otero went on to become a drummer in a Beatles tribute band. He enters the stage singing With a Little Help From My Friends, explaining: â€œSince Iâ€™m the drummer, I sing the songs Ringo used to sing.â€</p> <p>Itâ€™s a line that brings a laugh but it also tells a story about the things that unite us. Otero has been to the UK before with this band, and he loves the Beatles. To see him and Vallejo, Jackson and Sagastume rock out on stage with electric guitars, bass and drums is to witness four men in late middle age doing what plenty of men of that vintage do. The difference, of course, is that at one point, for reasons that none of them held that dear, they were trying to kill each other. Now they seem the best of friends.</p> <p>â€œFor myself,â€ says Armour, â€œthe play just reinforces what I already knew. People in conventional forces are just the same. Weâ€™re not driven by a crazed ideology. I knew they [the Argentinians] were going to be good people. I wouldnâ€™t be able to say the same if I was fighting Isis. Lola was worried that there might be some serious rows and disagreements. But the war wasnâ€™t really driven by hatred. Why were we fighting? Because the Argentinians had invaded and we thought it was illegal. Why were they fighting? Because they thought it was theirs. We both knew that. But of all the problems in the world, have our countries got to go to war over this island?

He says itâ€™s helped in some ways and not in others. He loves being on stage, loves the acting, which he sees as an extension of his work as a teacher.

If you passed him on the street you probably wouldnâ€™t notice anything about him beyond his limp. But 35 years ago he yomped across the Falkland Islands and ran through a minefield under artillery fire on Mount Harriet. His section killed several Argentinians in a bloody battle and Armour found himself attending to a fatally wounded Argentinian soldier who spoke to him in English about visiting Oxford. He watched as the young man died. Gabriel Sagastume is a grey-haired lawyer with sleepy eyes and an easy smile. He was an Argentinian conscript during the Falklands war and was positioned on Wireless Ridge. His unit was short of food and so several of them waded across a river to a nearby house to raid its kitchen. When they came back they were blown up by a mine, planted by the Argentinian army. It was Sagastumeâ€™s job to collect the body parts and put them in his blanket. These sobering anecdotes are recounted in Minefield, a fascinating piece of documentary theatre about the Falklands war and its aftermath. It features six veterans, three from each side of the conflict, and was devised by the Argentinian artist and writer Lola Arias. Itâ€™s currently touring the country, having already been across Europe. After the two Iraq wars, the Afghan conflict and various military involvements in Bosnia, Kosovo, Libya and Syria, the Falklands war has disappeared into history. It was always a strange and incredible conflict, famously summarised by the great Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges as â€œtwo bald men fighting over a combâ€. Until they were invaded by Argentinian forces on 2 April 1982, the Falkland Islands did not loom large in the nationâ€™s consciousness. Most Britons would have been hard-pressed to locate them on a map. These windswept outcrops 300 miles off the Argentinian coast were home to fewer than 2,000 people back then. Yet in the battle for them 907 people lost their lives and almost 2,000 more were injured, some very seriously. The invaders were defeated by the British task force sent by the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. The victory hugely boosted her flagging popularity and led to the downfall of the military junta in control of Argentina. These are the events that form the backdrop to Minefield, but itâ€™s not a play that explores the rights and wrongs of that conflict or, indeed, any other. What it does is look at the human experience of war and in particular what happens to those who go through it when they return to â€œnormalâ€ life. The Falklands war was one of the shortest in British military history, lasting just 74 days. But its effects on participants have continued for decades. Thereâ€™s a line in the play that says the rehearsals for the show went on longer than the conflict. And for Armour those rehearsals, in Buenos Aires, were a difficult process that led to him consulting a therapist for the first time in his life. Armourâ€™s mother died when he was a year old, and he was brought up in a foster family he hated. He joined the Royal Marines at 16. They became his family. He was part of a Royal Marine detachment that was on the island when the Argentinians&nbsp;invaded. He and 50 or so other marines tried to defend Port Stanley, the capital, but were overpowered by much larger numbers and surrendered. They were sent back to the UK. Armour was asked if he wanted to return with the task force. He immediately said yes, but is that a decision heâ€™s ever regretted? â€œNo,â€ he says. â€œI was a young section commander at the time. The idea of my section going back and me not being there to lead them, whatever came, was total anathema to&nbsp;me.â€ In military terms, it was by no means a straightforward mission. The task force took six weeks to sail to the South Atlantic. Along the way, recalls David Jackson, a tall, ramrod-straight former Royal Marine and now a practising psychologist, the soldiers were briefed on what awaited them. Jackson says in the play that he was told: â€œWe are expecting one in three to be killed in initial landings.â€ Despite this grim prediction, the marines stuck to their training schedule and held impromptu disco parties on board ship in the evenings. Routine suppressed fear and doubt â€“ until the real fighting began. The Falklands war was unlike many modern wars. Yes, there were fighter jets and Exocet missiles and lots of other impressive weapons of destruction. But most of the fighting was like something out of the first world war, with one force dug into its positions and the other seeking to oust them. There were plenty of close-contact battles, sometimes hand-to-hand combat. The initial landings were not as lethal as Jackson had been told to expect. Nonetheless if the war was short, it was also brutal and nasty. Aside from all the casualties on the islands, there was another in Argentina â€“ the military government. Headed by General Galtieri, it had stoked up nationalist fervour, portraying the invasion of the Malvinas, as the islands are known in Argentina, as a great patriotic liberation of an imperially occupied part of the motherland. Galtieri promised that the British would be defeated and taught a lesson. When that didnâ€™t happen, his government lost its last remnants of credibility. For several years, the dictatorship had suppressed opposition with a ruthless campaign of violence, torture and murder in what was known as the dirty war. Many opponents were â€œdisappearedâ€, either into secret jails or, often, dumped into the Atlantic. One of the questions I ask the Argentinian members of the cast when we meet at the Royal Court theatre in London is whether it was worth losing the war to get that outcome. â€œItâ€™s a fact,â€ says Sagastume, â€œthat the dictatorship fell because of the war. Even in Argentina where we discuss politics all the time, this is not something everyone believes in. In my opinion, from an institutional point of view there was nothing else fighting the dictatorship. There were women walking around asking for their kidnapped children, but no big demonstrations. It was the war that really ended the junta. There was big support for the war among the people. And when the war was ended, they were ashamed that they supported the war in the beginning.â€ There are in a political sense two ways of viewing the war that remain at the centre of ongoing debates about international conflict. From one perspective it was an imperial endeavour, a jingoistic effort to defend the union jack in a far-off place about which few Britons knew or cared. Another argument is that it was a fight against fascism and in favour of democracy. After all, the Falkland Islanders themselves wanted to remain under British jurisdiction. And they certainly had no wish to be taken over by a military dictatorship. On the whole, progressive sentiment subscribed to the first reading of the war, and saw the second as a fig leaf. Certainly the second case was not helped by the stringent controls imposed on the media by the Thatcher government. Almost no news emerged from the conflict zone that wasnâ€™t first approved by the government censors. Nor was the anti-fascist cause made any more credible by the murky past relations between the British and Argentinian regimes. As Julian Barnes put it, reflecting on the war many years later: â€œThe fact that weâ€™d traded with the junta, welcomed its leaders and sold arms to them, but now realised that it was a filthy dictatorship after all, was swallowed without a burp. The fact that there were a mere 1,800 islanders, and that their way of life was preserved at the cost of 1,000 British casualties and 1,800 Argentinian ones did not seem a grossly stupid and expensive way of conducting foreign policy; it proved that freedom is indivisible, tyranny will be defeated, and the wishes of the loyal locals sovereign.â€ However, to the soldiers involved it wasnâ€™t an intellectual debate, it was a matter of life and death.

The soldier crouches at a terrifying angle to hang his victorious banner above burned-out Berlin in May 1945. It is a famous shot â€“ the figure high among the parapets beneath a thunderous sky â€“ and known to have been staged, like the marines hoisting the flag at Iwo Jima. But in this context, one sees it completely new. The photographer was Jewish. His father and sisters had been murdered by the Nazis. His uncle made the flag by hand, the hammer and sickle glowing an immaculate white almost at the epicentre of this dark image. And what has inspired Yevgeny Khaldei is not just the possibility of raising the figure high among the parapets, a worker on the same level as the imperial statues, but the dynamic geometries of Russian abstract art. His scene is all triangles and heroic diagonals, harking back to El Lissitzky and Malevich. It would be hard to overstate the visual impact of Red Star Over Russia at Tate Modern.
