The data is produced by the official Public Health England and its counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, records the number of deaths in a 24-hour reporting period. Earlier data on Sunday published by NHS England, the body which leads the state-funded health system in Britain’s most populous nation, said there had been 327 deaths reported by hospitals in England in the reporting period. The discrepancy between these two totals is because the NHS England figure records the date when deaths are reported by hospitals, which is not necessarily the same day they occurred. The UK-wide figures collated by Public Health England are based on when deaths occurred rather than when they were reported by hospitals. Italy has reported 174 new coronavirus deaths, its lowest toll since 168 fatalities were registered when the country’s lockdown started on March 10. The Mediterranean country’s toll on the eve of its first easing of lockdown measures on Monday officially stands at 28,884 dead, second only to the United States. The 1,389 new infections were also the lowest since the first week of March. The UK will trial a new coronavirus tracing programme next week on the Isle of Wight, just off the south coast of England, cabinet minister Michael Gove has announced as the government looks to minimise the risk of a second wave of infection. Suffering one of the worst death tolls in Europe from Covid-19, Britain is confident that the peak of the virus has passed and is now looking at how to restart its shuttered economy and ease social restrictions on citizens, according to the Press Association. “This week we will be piloting new test, track and trace procedures on the Isle of Wight with a view to having that in place more widely later this month,” Gove said. Gove said the system being trialled next week would include asking citizens on the island to download a smartphone app as well as traditional ways of tracing those who have come into contact with a patient who has tested positive. Greece is preparing to evacuate hundreds of migrants from a notoriously overcrowded island camp to the mainland, according to AFP. Two groups, of 142 and 250 “vulnerable” migrants will board ferries from the island of Lesbos, according to a police source, after leaving the “deplorable” conditions in Moria camp. In April, Human Rights Watch urged Greek authorities to act quickly to ward off a potential health crisis in migrant camps lest the coronavirus take hold there. The sites are battling rampant overcrowding, poor sanitation, lack of proper water supplies and rudimentary healthcare. A transfer from the Moria camp would be the first since confinement measures were imposed on March 23 to stem the spread of Covid-19. A few days before that around 600 migrants had been transferred to the Greek mainland. An estimated 37,000 migrants live in terrible conditions on five Greek islands in the Aegean Sea. The camps were built to house 6,200 people. Moria holds around 19,300 migrants, more than six times its capacity. Plans to alleviate overcrowding were stalled by the discovery of Covid-19 cases among migrants on the mainland. But Greek officials now plan to move around 2,000 people from the islands, and migration minister Notis Mitarachi said recently that 10,000 had reached the mainland in the first three months of the year. Around 150 migrants on the mainland have tested positive for the virus, but up till now, no cases have been reported in the overcrowded island camps. French feminist advocacy groups are reporting an increase in sexual assault and harassment incidents in broad daylight by aggressors who know their victims are unlikely to be able to summon help. Fatima Benomar, a 36-year-old rights activist, said she was hounded by several youths on the Rue de Rivoli in Paris, a wide-open thoroughfare that has been emptied of cars and passers-by. “They came up because I was ignoring their catcalls, and started insulting and threatening me,” Benomar told AFP. “It was incredibly scary.” “There wasn’t any way to escape, all the stores were closed and there was nobody to ask for help,” she said. Police have been urging victims or witnesses to report any cases. They have not released official figures on the number of assault reports during the lockdown. But prosecutors reported last week that two women were raped in public spaces within 24 hours of each other - one in a park, the other on a street - in Seine-Saint-Denis, just north of Paris. Singapore has confirmed 657 new coronavirus cases, the vast majority of them foreign workers living in dormitories, taking the city-state’s total to 18,205. Reuters reports the health ministry announced one death, an 86-year-old Singaporean woman, bringing the country’s death toll to 18. Among the new infections, ten were Singaporeans or permanent residents, while 626 cases were foreign workers living in dormitories, the ministry said. Singapore has among the highest number of coronavirus infections in Asia, mainly due to outbreaks in cramped migrant-worker dormitories. It has managed to curb the spread of the disease among locals outside the dormitories. Singapore will start easing coronavirus restrictions over the next few weeks, authorities said on Saturday. In a trial at a restaurant in the city of Arnhem, Netherlands, McDonald’s has been looking for ways to maintain social distancing when the coronavirus lockdown is relaxed, Reuters reports. Adjustments such as Big Macs delivered on meal trolleys, hand sanitisers at restaurant entrances and designated waiting spots are being tested. Restaurants, bars and other public places in the Netherlands have been closed since March 15. As of Friday, 39,791 coronavirus cases had been confirmed with 4,893 deaths. But new infections have been dropping, prompting calls to loosen the lockdown after its current deadline of May 19. A decision on whether to reopen restaurants and bars is expected around May 12, but Prime Minister Mark Rutte has ruled out a return to normal. If they do reopen, they will have to keep customers and staff at least 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart to avoid a new wave of infections. About three quarters of McDonald’s 39,000 restaurants worldwide were operational as of Thursday, including almost all its nearly 14,000 outlets in the United States, where drive-throughs are common. The UK daily briefing has been delayed and is expected to begin within the next 15 minutes. Head over to the UK live blog to follow Downing Street’s daily coronavirus briefing. Hello, I’ll be taking over the live blog for the next few hours. If you have a news tip, comment or suggestion, please get in touch via Twitter DM @cleaskopeliti or by email at clea.skopeliti.casual@guardian.co.uk. Thanks in advance. I’m passing you on now to my colleague, Clea Skopeliti, who will continue to bring you the day’s Coronavirus news from around the world on this live blog. Thanks for all your emails, tweets and comments over the past eight hours. The Pope has called for any successful Covid-19 vaccine to be shared worldwide. He said international scientific cooperation would be important in discovering a vaccine, stressing that it is “important to unite scientific capabilities, in a transparent and impartial way”. NHS England has announced a further 327 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19. The total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England is now 21,180. A coalition of artists, celebrities, scientists and intellectuals has warned that Brazil’s indigenous peoples are at grave risk of a Covid-19 “genocide”. Madonna, Oprah Winfrey, Brad Pitt, David Hockney and Paul McCartney are among those who have signed an open letter to the country’s president, Jair Bolsonaro. Vietnam has confirmed its first Coronavirus case in nine days, meaning its total now stands at 271. The country’s lockdown was eased in late April and it is yet to record a Covid-19 death. Footballers in Serie A, Italy’s top division, will be allowed to start individual training sessions from Monday. It is the latest step in a series of cautious moves towards restarting top-level sport across Europe, which has also seen players in England and Germany permitted different degrees of training ground work. One third of 500 random coronavirus tests in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, have come back positive. It has raised fears that one of the world’s most fragile states may be harbouring widespread undetected infections. Primary schools in England could reopen on 1 June. Here is more from our education editor, Richard Adams: One third of 500 random coronavirus tests in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, came back positive, health officials have said, raising fears of widespread undetected infections in one of the world’s most fragile states. The results are concerning, said public health ministry spokesman Wahid Mayar. Afghanistan has performed only limited testing so far: close to 12,000, with more than 2,700 confirmed infections, in a nation of 36.6 million. As more testing becomes available, the country’s confirmed infection numbers will likely rise sharply, said Mayar. He urged residents to stay home. Kabul and most other cities are in lockdown, but compliance has not been widespread. The death toll, officially at 85, could also be much higher. More than 250,000 Afghans returned home from Iran since the beginning of the year, fanning out across their country without being tested or quarantined. Anecdotal reports have emerged of dozens of returnees dying of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. At a recent briefing, a senior government official said 40 people died of the virus in Sarobi district, barely 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Kabul. The Health Ministry said it could not confirm the claim, reports AP. The country’s health care system, devastated by four decades of war, is woefully unprepared for a major outbreak. It has only 400 ventilators. An international media rights group says the coronavirus pandemic is being used by governments around the world to increase restrictions on press freedoms, AP reports. In a report issued to coincide with World Press Freedom Day 2020, the International Press Institute concluded that in both democratic and autocratic states the public health crisis has allowed governments to exercise control over the media on the pretext of preventing the spread of disinformation. It said authoritarian governments have been abusing emergency measures to further stifle independent media and criminalise journalism, while in democracies efforts to control the public narrative and restrict access to information around the pandemic are on the rise. The Vienna-based organisation said it has documented 162 press freedom violations related to coronavirus coverage over the past two and a half months, almost a third of which have involved the arrest, detention or charging of journalists. The institute’s report came three days after the International Federation of Journalists published a survey that found that the working conditions of news reporters around the globe have deteriorated during the coronavirus pandemic amid job losses and attacks on media freedom. Earlier, Egypt was singled out by Amnesty International for its treatment of journalists over the last four years. Our US live blog is now up and running. Martin Pengelly has all the Coronavirus updates from New York and beyond; Donald Trump has once again awoken in vocal mood: Top executives of Emirates and Etihad, two of the Middle East’s biggest airlines, have said passenger demand may not return to pre-coronavirus crisis levels until 2023, reports AFP. About 85% of the world’s airlines could face financial distress by the end of the year without government aid, Emirates president Tim Clark and Etihad CEO Tony Douglas told a video conference hosted by the US-UAE Business Council last week. Clark and Douglas reiterated their beliefs that until an effective vaccine for the COVID-19 respiratory disease becomes widely available, how passengers fly will be different, a statement by the council said. Lasting restrictions like 14-day quarantines, testing, and social distancing will impact demand and operations, they said. The airlines could not be reached for comment. Emirates and Etihad, which operate fleets of over 370 aircraft, a majority of them wide-bodied, have grounded their operations in March and are serving limited outbound flights to take repatriate foreigners from the United Arab Emirates. Dubai is expected to resume welcoming tourists by July, more than four months after halting the vital sector due to the coronavirus pandemic, an official said. The return, however, will be gradual and could be delayed until September, Helal al-Marri, the director general of Dubai’s Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing, told Bloomberg TV last week. A majority of global airlines have also stopped operations due to shutdowns imposed to counter the spread of coronavirus. This global report from Sam Jones in Madrid focuses further on the easing of lockdown measures in Spain and Italy. In Spain, where 217,466 cases of Covid-19 and 25,264 deaths have been confirmed, adults were allowed back on to the street to exercise for the first time in seven weeks this weekend. Small shops, such as bookshops, hardware stores and hair salons were due to reopen on Monday, serving customers by appointment, along with restaurants for the collection of takeaways. The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has announced that the wearing of face masks will be mandatory on public transport, and that 14.5m masks will be handed out across the country. Sánchez also confirmed that his coalition government would be seeking MPs’ approval this week to extend the state of emergency declared on 14 March until 24 May. “We’re winning the battle against the epidemic, but the cost in lives and sacrifices has been very high,” he said on Saturday. Here it is in full: Test results suggesting people in South Korea had been reinfected after recovering from Covid-19 were actually false positives caused by dead lung cells, the World Health Organisation’s technical lead, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show today. You can watch the video here: Footballers in Serie A, Italy’s top division, will be allowed to start individual training sessions from Monday in the latest cautious step towards a restart for sport across Europe. “Athletes and non athletes, of non individual disciplines, just like any citizen, are allowed to practise individual sporting activities, in private and public areas, in respect of the interpersonal safety distance of at least two metres and in respect of the ban to gather in any form,” the Italian interior ministry said in a letter to local authorities. A number of clubs in England’s Premier League allowed players to work on an individual basis at their training grounds on a strict rota basis from last Monday, while players at clubs in the German Bundesliga are permitted to train in small, socially-distanced groups. The leagues in France and the Netherlands, however, have been concluded without any further activity taking place. NHS England has announced 327 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 21,180. More details on this, and the rest of the Covid-19 picture across the UK, from my colleague Nadeem Badshah. I’m back with you from now until around 4pm BST. Do send any hints, tips or observations to nick.ames@theguardian.com or @NickAmes82. Thanks for all your communications so far today. Nearly 3,000 cruise ship workers quarantined aboard a liner will undergo tests for the novel coronavirus, German travel group TUI said. “Mein Schiff 3” was being used to ferry 2,899 TUI employees and crew home with both cruises and the usual means of transport in much of Europe shut down by the pandemic. Problems began when the huge vessel docked at in the German North Sea port of Cuxhaven on April 28 with more than a dozen crew members showing flu-like symptoms. One of them then tested positive for the virus on Friday leading the company to quarantine everyone on board. A first wave of 229 tests on personnel who had been in contact with the infected crew member came back negative, TUI said. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said mosques would reopen across large parts of the country Monday, as officials reported a drop in the number of deaths from the novel coronavirus. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 47 people died of the virus over the past 24 hours, the lowest daily count in 55 days. He told a news conference he hoped “the trend will continue in the upcoming days”. His remarks came as President Hassan Rouhani said 132 counties, around one third of the country’s administrative divisions, would “reopen their mosques as of tomorrow”. “Social distancing is more important than collective prayer,” he said in a televised meeting of the country’s virus taskforce. The president argued that Islam considers safety obligatory, while praying in mosques is only “recommended”. Rouhani did not give the names of the counties affected by the measure or the number of mosques due to reopen on Monday. The measure is not expected to be implemented in the capital, Tehran, or in the main Shiite holy cities of Mashhad which are among those most affected by the outbreak. Mosques and some key Shiite shrines in Iran were closed in March amid the Middle East’s deadliest COVID-19 outbreak. The targeted counties are “low-risk”, Rouhani said. According to Jahanpour, the 47 new deaths brought to 6,203 the total number officially recorded in Iran since it reported its first cases in mid-February. He added that 976 fresh infection cases were confirmed in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 97,424. Hello everyone. I am going to be updating you on the latest developments while Nick takes lunch. Please do share your news tips, insights and comments with me. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Handing over to my colleague Sarah Marsh for the next hour or so of global coronavirus updates. Dutch health authorities have confirmed a daily increase of 335 coronavirus infections, meaning the country’s total is now 40,571, while 69 new deaths have been recorded. In total, the Netherlands has now seen 5,056 fatalities. This rise means the Netherlands is still 15th in the global ranking of Covid-19 cases, although the authorities have warned that the actual number of infections is probably higher because not all suspected patients are being tested. For those waking up in the US around now, Gene Marks has written a guide for small businesses who may not be covered by the government’s paycheck protection program (PPP). If that applies to you, there could be other funding streams available. Our coronavirus world map, curated by Pablo Gutiérrez, has up-to-date visuals displaying where the virus has spread and where its impact has been most significant. Vietnam has confirmed its first Coronavirus case in nine days, meaning its total now stands at 271. The country of 95 million locked down for more than a month but began to re-open in late April. To date it has not recorded any deaths caused by Covid-19. Pope Francis has called for international scientific cooperation to discover a vaccine for the coronavirus and said any successful vaccine should be made available around the world, Reuters reports. “In fact, it is important to unite scientific capabilities, in a transparent and impartial way to find vaccines and treatments,” he said when delivering his Sunday address from the papal library in the Vatican City, a measure necessitated by the Italian lockdown. He added that it was also important to “guarantee universal access to essential technologies that allow each infected person, in every part of the world, to receive the necessary medical treatment”. The pope also backed a proposal by an inter-religious group known as the Higher Committee on Human Fraternity for an international day of prayer and fasting on 14 May to ask God to help humanity overcome the pandemic. Brazil’s indigenous peoples are at grave risk of a Covid-19 “genocide”, a coalition of artists, celebrities, scientists and intellectuals has warned. Madonna, Oprah Winfrey, Brad Pitt, David Hockney and Paul McCartney are among those who have signed an open letter to the country’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, warning that warned the pandemic meant indigenous communities in the Amazon faced “an extreme threat to their very survival”. They have warned that these communities, decimated centuries ago by diseases brought by European colonisers, may now disappear completely. Tom Phillips reports from Rio de Janeiro: Italy’s two-month shutdown will partially ease from tomorrow onwards. This has been known for almost two weeks, but a report by AFP suggests many are still in the dark about what they will – and won’t – be permitted to do. They quote Pietro Garlanti, a 53-year-old cleaner in Rome, asking: “I’m hoping this morning’s paper will clear it up. I want to take my old mum to the sea-side, can I?” Italians will be able to move more freely within their own regions, visiting relatives, going to the re-opened parks with their children and going cycling or running further from home. But these activities cannot be undertaken in groups and people will not be allowed to leave their regions unless for an essential reason. But several of the 20 regions have come up with their own interpretations of the rules. Veneto and Calabria have already relaxed their lockdowns, allowing restaurants and bars with outdoor tables to open earlier in the week. Liguria is reopening its beaches. But a lack of clarity is causing significant concern. “We’ve been waiting with longing for May 4, but now it’s finally arrived it’s a letdown. Until they tell me I’m really free, I’ll feel paranoid, like I’m breaking the rules in some way,” 37-year old Michele Magna said. On Saturday the government published a Q&amp;A that explained people could see extended relatives, but not friends. Maternal care in the US has been derailed because of the coronavirus pandemic, writes Alexandra Villarreal. It poses a particularly serious problem for black mothers as they navigate the hospital system. Maternal care in the US, already flawed compared to similarly well-off countries, has been derailed because of the global coronavirus pandemic. Prenatal visits have transitioned to a combination of telehealth and in-person appointments where only the pregnant person is allowed to be physically present. Maternity units are also limiting visitors, usually to one, though some hospitals in Covid-19 hotspots have not allowed any. These changes have made deliveries difficult for all expecting mothers, regardless of a Covid-19 diagnosis, race or ethnicity. But even under “normal” circumstances, black mothers face a terrifying prospect as they navigate US hospitals, historically influenced by systemic racism and implicit biases, experts say. Add a global pandemic that’s overwhelming the country’s healthcare institutions, and advocates warn the outcome could be disastrous. “Black women aren’t trusted. They aren’t trusted to know and understand their own bodies,” said Nia Martin-Robinson, director of black leadership and engagement at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Read the piece in full here: Armenia will reopen some shops, restaurants and bars from Monday. It marks the start of a significant relaxation of restrictions that will also see manufacturing resume and restraints upon movement lifted. Confirmation of the easing was given by Tigran Avinyan, the deputy prime minister, and came despite a recent rise in confirmed infections. The country has registered 2,386 cases of the coronavirus and 35 deaths, with the number of infections rising from an average of 50 a day in mid-April to more than 100 in recent days, including 134 registered on Wednesday. Reuters reports that Armenia is looking to ease the hit on an economy that could shrink by 2% this year. Smaller shops, beauty salons and dry cleaners will open on Monday, Avinyan stated on social media. Malls, trade centres, markets and all schools and colleges will remain closed for now, however, while public transport is to remain suspended. Russia has announced its biggest daily increase in Covid-19 cases to date. The country’s coronavirus crisis response centre reported 10,633 new cases and 58 deaths, increasing the total fatalities to 1,280. Afghanistan has confirmed its highest rise both in coronavirus cases and deaths. The country confirmed 235 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, marking its biggest one-day rise of new infections, and 12 patients died overnight – bringing the total number of infections to 2,704 and death toll to 85. Japan could start easing its coronavirus curbs. Parks and museums are among the facilities that could reopen soon, as long as strict preventative measures are adhered to. However, its state of emergency – which currently expires on Wednesday – is likely to be extended by another month. Spain has reported its lowest rise of Covid-19 deaths in six weeks. The health ministry announced a one-day rise of 164 deaths from coronavirus, meaning the country’s total is now 25,264. It is the smallest increase since 18 March. Meanwhile, confirmed cases of the virus in Spain rose to 217,466 today. Iran will reopen mosques across large parts of the country on Monday. The president, Hassan Rounani, confirmed that centres of worship in around one third of the country’s administrative division would be allowed to operate from tomorrow. He did, however, stress that “social distancing is more important than collective prayer”. Watchdogs in the US say Donald Trump’s links with donors and backers deserve scrutiny as huge amounts of federal funds are distributed. There are concerns that, even during an unprecedented national crisis, Trump’s priorities and campaign machine often tilt towards giving donors and political allies favours, access and publicity. Watchdog groups in the US say Donald Trump’s close ties with donors and backers deserve scrutiny as trillions in federal funds are handed out during the Covid-19 crisis. Peter Stone reports from Washington. Fracking billionaire and Trump donor Harold Hamm was among an elite group of oil and gas executives who met with the president in early April to press for federal help, including access to big loans for businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. It prompted Trump afterwards to promise to “make funds available to these very important companies”. Major Trump ally Tommy Fisher, who last year landed a $400m Army Corps of Engineers contract to build 31 miles of Trump’s border wall in Arizona, in April received another $7m from the army – despite an active investigation by a Pentagon watchdog into allegations of favouritism after Trump reportedly pushed for Fisher. Another big Trump donor, Mike Lindell, the chief executive of MyPillow and the chair of Trump’s campaign in Minnesota, got red-carpet treatment from Trump at a press briefing in late March. Lindell then praised Trump, hailing him as “chosen by God” as the president touted the firm’s efforts to make thousands of face masks. As evidence of lockdown regulations being loosened in some parts of Europe, Reuters has reported on the return to action of Austria’s tennis players. Players can compete again, in singles format, with no touching of each other’s match balls and no handshaking. Golf, horse riding, archery, shooting and mini-golf are among other social distancing-compatible sports to have been given the green light since Friday in the country’s second wave of lockdown easing. Our daily roundup of coronavirus developments across Australia is now up, courtesy of Christopher Knaus. Indonesia’s health ministry has reported 349 new coronavirus cases and 14 new deaths. The country’s total number of infections now stands at 11,192, with 845 deaths in total. More than 83,000 people have been tested. Neighbouring Malaysia has reported 122 new cases, meaning the total now stands at 6,298. Its health ministry also reported two new deaths, raising the total number of fatalities to 105 Here is a big Sunday piece by Ed Pilkington, chief reporter for Guardian US. Three years of hostility to evidence-based policy have led to a crisis in which the Donald Trump’s ill-informed, self-serving “hunches” have deadly consequences – but how will the president’s war on science play out? Three months into the pandemic, with the number of confirmed cases passing 1 million, the tension that has been simmering for months between Trump and the scientific world is at boiling point. His improvisation about injecting disinfectant encapsulated the sense of demoralisation – of despair, almost – that many American scientists now feel about the drift from evidence-based leadership. Full article: Spain’s health ministry has reported a one-day rise of 164 deaths from coronavirus, meaning the country’s total is now 25,264. It is the lowest increase since 18 March. Meanwhile confirmed cases of the virus rose to 217,466 today, from 216,582 on Saturday. Iran will reopen mosques across large parts of the country on Monday, the country’s president Hassan Rouhani has confirmed. Mosques have been closed since early March after the coronavirus outbreak intensified, but AFP quote Rouhani saying 132 counties, around one third of the country’s administrative divisions, would “reopen their mosques as of tomorrow”. “Social distancing is more important than collective prayer,” he added, arguing that Islam considers safety obligatory, while praying in mosques is only “recommended”. The targeted counties are “low-risk”, Rouhani said in a televised meeting of the country’s virus taskforce. He said the committee was also mulling reopening schools by May 16 to allow for a month of classes before the summer break. Covid-19 has killed more than 6,150 and infected over 96,440 in Iran since it announced its first cases in mid-February. On Saturday, the country reported its lowest daily toll of new infections since 10 March.

Tensions aboard the Greg Mortimer, an Australian cruise ship that spent a month stranded off the South American coast and remains in limbo, are running high amid allegations that the ship’s operators and captain pressured the chief medical officer to mislead authorities in Uruguay about the health situation onboard. Thirty-three members of its crew have been diagnosed with Covid-19 and one has died. Uki Goñi reports: Japan could start easing some of its coronavirus-enforced curbs, with parks and museums among the facilities being slated to reopen. The economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura is quoted by Reuters as saying certain restrictions may be eased as long as the correct preventative measure are imposed. “As long as the proper preventive measures are in place, it could be possible to ease some of the current restrictions on economic activities,” Nishimura said. Places like parks, museums, art galleries, and libraries could reopen even in the 13 prefectures where coronavirus has spread rapidly, if they take steps to disinfect their premises and ensure visitors maintain their distance, he added. Further details of how restrictions might be eased will be discussed at an experts’ meeting on Monday. Regardless, Japan’s state of emergency – which currently expires on Wednesday – is expected to be extended by another month. Covid-19 has infected 15,589 people and killed 530 in the country. The developed world’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic is imperilling health systems, economies and livelihoods elsewhere in the world that were already on the edge, writes Simon Tisdall. The west’s self-absorption threatens to obscure the virus’s harmful impact on treatment of non-Covid, preventable diseases. Just as UK cancer deaths are forecast to rise due to a diversion of resources, so measles and other immunisation programmes in poorer nations are being undercut. The WHO announced last week that polio vaccinations for up to 12 million children in Africa will be delayed as resources are switched to fighting Covid-19. It admitted the move would inevitably lead to more child polio cases. Disrupted vaccination programmes have frequently led to “explosive” outbreaks of life-threatening diseases previously held in abeyance, warned vaccine specialist Edward Parker. “Without systematic efforts to maintain immunisation programmes, the virus’s legacy could include a disastrous surge in childhood deaths.” The pandemic is providing cover for malign governments to pursue or accelerate policies that place lives at risk, regardless of Covid-19. A striking example is Myanmar, where the army has renewed its repression of minorities in Rakhine and Chin states. Six new polio cases have been reported in Afghanistan as the war-torn country recorded its highest one-day rise of new coronavirus cases and deaths, triggered by the continued surge of transmission in Kandahar and Kabul amid an intensified war across the country. The country confirmed 235 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, marking its biggest one-day rise of new infections, and 12 patients died overnight – bringing the total number of infections to 2,704 and death toll to 85. There have so far been 345 recoveries. Wahidullah Mayar, a health ministry spokesman, said 256 health workers have also tested positive in the country. Most of the new infections were confirmed in Kabul, raising the total number of transmissions to 680 – with 63 reported in the last 25 hours. Kabul is the country’s worst-affected area and authorities have implemented a lockdown in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. Despite the lockdown in several provinces, in most cities streets are still crowded with vehicles and people walking freely around. Experts fear that may be a challenge in the fight with Covid-19. The disease may cause huge collateral damage among Afghanistan’s many vulnerable citizens. Save the Children has already warned that lockdowns – although they are being widely ignored – have put seven million children at risk of hunger. Meanwhile, Mayar said on Saturday that six new polio cases were recorded in the country, mostly in the southern province of Kandahar. Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria are the only three countries in the world where polio remains endemic. War continued to intensify in the country. A government spokesman said 17 civilians were killed by the Taliban in the first week of Ramadan. Russia has recorded its highest daily rise in confirmed Covid-19 cases, with 10,633 new cases listed today. It brings the overall number to 134,686. A further 58 deaths have been reported by the country’s coronavirus crisis response centre, increasing the total number of fatalities to 1,280. Our UK live blog is now up and running, with Ben Quinn – you can join it here: Pharma giant Roche gets US go-ahead for Covid-19 antibody test Swiss drug maker Roche Holding AG says it has received emergency use approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an antibody test to help determine if people have ever been infected with the coronavirus. Governments, businesses and individuals are seeking such blood tests to help them learn more about who may have had the disease, who may have some immunity and to potentially craft strategies to end lockdowns that have battered global economies. Roche had previously pledged to make its antibody test available by early May and to boost production by June to “high double-digit millions” per month. Singapore has confirmed 657 new coronavirus infections, taking its total to 18,205. According to the country’s health ministry, most of the new cases were diagnosed among migrant workers living in dormitories. After Covid-19: How will a socially distanced high street actually work? Britain’s once bustling high streets are now eerily quiet, with all non-essential shops closed and thousands of staff furloughed. Many may never reopen as the lockdown accelerates shifts to online shopping, while others will have to find ways to adapt to a radically different retail world of long-term social distancing rules and nervous customers afraid of catching the virus. The British Independent Retailers Association warned last week that one fifth of their members might close for good if footfall is low. Yet some of the big non-food retailers such as Homebase and B&amp;Q are starting to reopen stores, and the British Retail Consortium has issued guidance on how non-essential shops could trade while keeping customers and staff safe. The Observer spoke to five shop owners on one British high street to find out how they are faring and what the future holds for their businesses. Hello, this is Nick Ames and I’ll be with you for the next eight hours or so as our coverage of live coronavirus news from around the world continues. If you have any tips, suggestions, feedback or anything else then please feel free to email me at nick.ames@theguardian.com or send me a direct message on Twitter @NickAmes82. That’s it for me, Helen Sullivan, for today. I have just one question before I go: did you remember to video-chat the eels? Let me know here. In case you missed it, they’re forgetting humans exist: Global cases near 3.5 million as death toll approaches 250,000. According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker there were 3,428,422 confirmed cases worldwide on Sunday, with 243,831 people losing their lives to the disease. The US continues to be the most affected country, with more than 1.3 million cases and 66,385 deaths. Warren Buffett says ‘world has changed’ for airlines. The legendary American investor has dumped his firm’s holdings in the four major US airlines, warning that the “world has changed” for the aviation industry in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. In comments that will send shockwaves through financial markets already pulverised by the economic shock of the outbreak, Buffett said the outbreak could have an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible economic outcomes. Only 17% of Brits want schools, pubs and restaurants reopened. Fewer than one in five Britons believe the time is right to consider reopening schools, restaurants, pubs and stadiums. The findings, in a new poll for the Observer, suggest Boris Johnson will struggle to convince people to return their lives to normal if he tries to ease the lockdown soon. Half of UK doctors say they have had to source their own PPE. Almost half of Britain’s doctors have sourced their own personal protective equipment or relied on a donation when none was available through normal NHS channels, according to a survey. The British Medical Association said its latest survey was the biggest of frontline NHS staff during the coronavirus crisis. European leaders join forces to combat Covid-19. European leaders have pledged to raise billions of pounds to help find a vaccine and treatments for Covid-19 as part of an “international alliance” fighting the disease. An online pledging conference due to be held on Monday will aim to pull in €7.5bn (£6.6bn) in funding to support the global response to the coronavirus pandemic. YouTube deletes conspiracy theorist David Icke’s account. The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old conspiracy theorist David Icke had violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus. The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network. India imposes jail lockdowns as virus spreads in overcrowded prisons. The spread of the coronavirus in India’s notoriously crowded prisons has prompted authorities to impose jail lockdowns and release thousands of pretrial detainees on parole, as health experts worry that the cramped facilities are serving as breeding grounds for the disease. Boris Johnson’s doctors had plan to announce his death. Boris Johnson has revealed that doctors prepared to announce his death as he spent three nights in intensive care last month. Britain’s PM told the Sun on Sunday: “They had a strategy to deal with a ‘death of Stalin’-type scenario. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong.” Johnson, 55, said: “The bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. That was when it got a bit ... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally.” Travel within China surges. China’s most populous cities saw a leap in outbound travellers, tourists and day-trippers on 1 May, first day of a long holiday weekend, led by Wuhan, epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic that first struck the country late last year. The number of people travelling outside their home cities jumped nearly 50% at the start of the Labour Day weekend, compared with the first day of the Tomb Sweeping holiday on 4 April, according to Reuters calculations on data from China’s internet giant Baidu Inc. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan with questions, comments and news from your part of the world. “We forget that flu once plagued the economy as coronavirus does today,” writes William Keegan, the Observer’s senior economics commentator. It is a sobering thought that, according to the many well-researched accounts to have appeared in recent weeks, this Johnson/Cummings government seems to have been prepared to risk 250,000 deaths from the policy of “herd immunity”. This approach was, mercifully, laid to rest after the intervention of Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, on 16 March. There followed the introduction of lockdown and what some of us prefer to call “physical distancing.” Commentators have been putting the 27,000 or more deaths in this country attributed to the virus so far in the context of the 60,000 civilian deaths recorded during the second world war. This is bad enough. But I wonder how many people are aware that during the “Spanish” flu epidemic of 1918-21, which followed the first world war, the estimated loss of life in this country was, well, 250,000? The number of households with children going hungry has doubled since lockdown began, as millions of people struggle to afford food. New data from the Food Foundation shared exclusively with the Observer has revealed that almost a fifth of households with children have been unable to access enough food in the past five weeks, with meals being skipped and children not getting enough to eat as already vulnerable families battle isolation and a loss of income. The strain on larger families, single parent homes and those with disabled children has been immense. A reported 30% of lone parents and 46% of parents with a disabled child are facing food insecurity and finding it difficult to manage basic nutritional needs at home. With schools no longer providing a reprieve for children reliant on free breakfast clubs and school lunches, poorer families are at crisis point. Pandemic! by Slavoj Žižek; Where Is God in a Coronavirus World? by John Lennox – review Detained at home with time to write instant books, two septuagenarian sages here make very different attempts to wrest a meaning or moral from the coronavirus pandemic. The Slovenian theorist Slavoj Žižek treats the disease as an intellectual malaise from which we will only be rescued by a “philosophical revolution”; John Lennox, an Oxford mathematician who moonlights as a Christian evangelist, approaches Covid-19 as a theological conundrum and tries to explain why God seems so unbothered by our distress. While clinicians work on decoding the coronavirus, Žižek unhelpfully inflates it to an imaginary bogey, a “spectral fantasy”. In the absence of a vaccine, Lennox prescribes prayer, which at least is better advice than injecting bleach. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Elsewhere, the pandemics danger remained evident. Pakistan followed Russia in reporting its biggest one-day spike in new infections. Pakistan announced nearly 1,300 new cases Saturday, raising the total in the country of 220 million people to about 18,000. The government has said it might ease controls, but doctors have pleaded for stricter lockdowns, warning an explosion of infections would overwhelm hospitals, AP reports. Moscow is considering establishing temporary hospitals at sports complexes and shopping malls to deal with the influx of patients. Russia has reported around 125,000 cases and more than 1,200 deaths, but the actual numbers are believed to be much higher because not everyone is tested. Singapore announced Saturday it will let selected businesses reopen from 12 May in a cautious rollback of a two-month partial lockdown, and Sri Lanka said the government and private sector should resume work from 11 May “to ensure a return to normalcy in civilian life and to revive the economy. Bangladesh, which opened thousands of garment factories last month, confirmed 552 new cases on Saturday. From the United States to Europe and Asia, people in many parts of the world are emerging from their homes as virus-related restrictions begin to ease and springtime temperatures climb, AP reports. Chinese were flocking to tourist spots, many newly reopened, after a relaxation of domestic travel restrictions ahead of a five-day holiday that runs through Tuesday. Nearly 1.7 million people visited Beijing parks on the first two days of the holiday, and Shanghai’s main tourist spots welcomed more than a million visitors, according to Chinese media reports. Many spots limited the number of daily visitors to 30% of capacity or less, keeping crowds below average. Masks were worn widely, from runners in Spain to beach-goers in the southern United States. In New York City’s Central Park, joggers moved past each other without a glance on Saturday, and a steady stream of folks left tips for a trio working their way through a set of jazz standards alfresco. Neighbouring New Jersey reopened state parks, though several had to turn people away after reaching a 50% limit in their parking lots. Warren Buffett dumps US airline stocks, saying ‘world has changed’ after Covid-19 Warren Buffett, the legendary American investor, has sold his firm’s entire holdings in the four major US airlines, warning that the “world has changed” for the aviation industry because of the coronavirus crisis. In comments that will send shockwaves through financial markets already pulverised by the economic shock of the outbreak, Buffett said the outbreak could have an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible outcomes. Shares around the world are poised for another torrid week as worldwide cases of the virus creep towards 3.5 million and deaths near 250,000. Despite massive central bank and government intervention, stock markets have been rocked by the continued spread of Covid-19, the plunge in oil prices and Donald Trump’s threats to reignite his trade war with China. Buffett, 89, who has become known as the Sage of Omaha for his investment skill over the decades, indicated that he believed stock markets had not reached the bottom of the current dip. Speaking at the virtual annual meeting of his company Berkshire Hathaway from Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett said he had not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing “attractive” enough, even after the recent plunge in the markets.

Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: Fewer than one in five of the British public believe the time is right to consider lifting lockdown. The findings, in a new poll for the Observer, suggest Boris Johnson will struggle to convince people to return their lives to normal if he tries to ease the lockdown soon. Primary schools in England and Wales could reopen for all in June. Children aged five to 11 could return to school from Monday 1 June as part of government plans to gradually ease lockdown measures, the Sunday Telegraph has reported. Number of people travelling outside home cities in China jumps 50% in a month. The number of people travelling outside their home cities jumped nearly 50% at the start of the Labour Day weekend, compared with the first day of the Tomb Sweeping holiday on 4 April, according to Reuters calculations on data from China’s internet giant Baidu Inc. Venezuela prison riot leaves 40 dead. A riot erupted at a prison in central Venezuela on Friday, killing at least 40 people and injuring 50 more, including a National Guard officer who was wounded by an explosion and the warden, who suffered a knife wound, authorities said. European leaders join forces to combat Covid-19. European leaders have pledged to raise billions of pounds to help find a vaccine and treatments for Covid-19 as part of an “international alliance” fighting the disease.

Nearly 3,000 crew quarantined on cruise ship in German port. Nearly 3,000 crew of a cruise ship belonging to German tourism giant TUI have been quarantined on board after one person tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the company said on Friday. France proposes 14-day quarantine on entry. Those entering France after the end of lockdown on 11 May could be subjected to a minimum of a fortnight in quarantine as part of a new proposed law which would extend the state of “health emergency” for weeks further. Businessman Warren Buffett has given an upbeat assessment of the US’ ability to withstand crises.“This is quite an experiment,” Buffett said. “I remain convinced ... that nothing can basically stop America.” Three new cases in Yemen. Fears of an outbreak are growing in the war-ravaged Gulf country after two new cases were confirmed in Aden and one in Taiz province, which is now set to seal its borders. Cinemagoing habits could see further long-term shift. Lockdown hit Trolls World Tour, an animated musical extravaganza about a group of pop-loving trolls, could become the most important film in recent Hollywood history after amassing digital sales of £80m in three weeks. China has published a short animation titled “Once Upon a Virus” mocking the U.S. response to the new coronavirus using Lego-like figures to represent the two countries, Reuters reports. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was confident the coronavirus may have originated in a Chinese virology lab, but declined to describe the evidence. In the animation posted online by China’s official Xinhua news agency, red curtains open to reveal a stage featuring Lego-like figures in the form of a terracotta warrior wearing a face mask and the Statue of Liberty. Washington and Beijing are locked in a war of words over the origins of the disease, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has grown into a global pandemic. The United States and other countries have accused China of misleading the world about the severity of the outbreak, and there are growing calls for an international inquiry into the origins of the virus. Lego’s press office wrote in an emailed statement on Saturday: “We weren’t involved in making the animation in any way.” Nearly 3,000 crew of a cruise ship belonging to German tourism giant TUI have been quarantined on board after one person tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the company said on Friday. Fifteen crew members of the “Mein Schiff 3” were tested after showing mild flu symptoms, with one of them testing positive for COVID-19. All 2,899 crew members would remain in quarantine on board in the ship’s home port of Cuxhaven on Germany’s North Sea coast until further notice, TUI said in a statement. The cruise ship had no passengers on board, TUI added. TUI, the leader in global tourism, has agreed a 1.8 billion euros ($1.9 billion) bridging loan from the German government to cushion the impact of COVID-19 on one of the hardest-hit sectors. A riot erupted at a prison in central Venezuela on Friday, killing at least 40 people and injuring 50 more, including a National Guard officer who was wounded by an explosion and the warden, who suffered a knife wound, authorities said. The upheaval at the Llanos Penitentiary Center started with an inmate protest demanding that their relatives be allowed to deliver them food and then an armed confrontation broke out between inmates and guards, lawmaker María Beatriz Martínez told The Associated Press. The National Guard officer was injured by a grenade explosion, said Martínez, who had access to an early report prepared by the town’s security forces. The prison is located in the city of Guanare, 450 kilometers (280 miles) south-west of the capital of Caracas. Venezuela has roughly 30 prisons and 500 jails that can hold an estimated 110,000 inmates. Human rights officials say the prisons are violent and badly overcrowded, with gangs that traffic weapons and drugs in control. According to the human rights group Venezuelan Prison Observatory, the Guanare prison was built to hold 750 inmates but is jammed beyond capacity with 2,500 inmates. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 793 to 162,496, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by 74 to 6,649, the tally showed. For more on the pandemic in Germany at the moment, the Guardian’s Kate Connolly and Kim Willsher have this report on Europe’s schools re-opening: Playgrounds began reopening in Germany on Friday and pupils aged 11 and 12 are due to return to school in a staggered system starting next week. Classes will be split in two and the groups will alternate between lessons at school and at home. Hygiene measures being adopted across Europe include strict handwashing and disinfection regimes, physical distancing and the demarcation of playgrounds into zones to ensure pupils do not mix more than necessary. Children will have to file out of classrooms at different times to maintain physical distancing. Germany has temporarily removed sport and music lessons from the curriculum because they are considered too great a risk, but older pupils already returned to sit exams last month. Nurseries will remain closed for all children, except those of key workers, for the time being. China’s most populous cities saw a spike in outbound travellers, tourists and day-trippers on 1 May, first day of a long holiday weekend, led by Wuhan, epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic that first struck the country late last year. The number of people travelling outside their home cities jumped nearly 50% at the start of the Labour Day weekend, compared with the first day of the Tomb Sweeping holiday on 4 April, according to Reuters calculations on data from China’s internet giant Baidu Inc. The increase in outbound travel during the five-day holiday, one of China’s peak tourism periods each year, would help lift the travel and hospitality sectors that have been hit hard by disruption from the coronavirus pandemic. The spike in tourism was led by increases in travellers from Wuhan, Beijing, Dalian, Tianjin and Jinan, with China having eased curbs on travel and relaxed rules on quarantine amid dwindling cases of the coronavirus. Hundreds of sightseeing spots have also been reopened, including the Forbidden City in Beijing, as authorities sought to revive and repair local economies. The country recorded more than 23 million domestic tourists on 1 May, according to China’s culture and tourism ministry. Hubei’s tourism department said its 22 reopened tourist sites saw 109,664 visitors on 1 May, down 87% from a year ago, while tourism revenue plunged 95% to 6.79 million yuan ($961,729). As more and more state and local officials announce the release of thousands of at-risk inmates from the nations adult jails and prisons, parents along with children rights groups and criminal justice experts say vulnerable youths should be allowed to serve their time at home, AP reports. But they say demands for large-scale releases have been largely ignored. Decisions are often not made at the state level, but instead carried out county by county, with individual judges reviewing juvenile cases one by one. Such legal hurdles have resulted in some kids with symptoms being thrown into isolation for 23 hours a day, in what amounts to solitary confinement, according to relatives and youth advocates. They say many have been cut off from programs, counsellors and school. Some have not been issued masks, social distancing is nearly impossible and they have been given limited access to phone calls home. One mother reported that her daughter was so cut off from the outside world with no TV and staff not wearing any protective gear that the girl had no idea a deadly virus was even circulating in America. In some states, authorities have been shuttling kids between facilities, trying to make sure sick and healthy young people are kept apart. Growing fears and frustrations have led to violence and mayhem not just in Louisiana, but at juvenile centres in other coronavirus hot spots such as New York. Young people are calling their parents to say they’re scared and desperate to escape. Sheriffs deputies responded to a facility in Portland, Oregon, this month after a disturbance broke out, but no injuries were reported. The Bolshoi ballet held its first online classes only this week, more than a month after lockdown began, AFP reports. In the middle of their bedroom, Bolshoi ballet dancers Margarita Shrainer and Igor Tsvirko have placed a linoleum mat and a barre. Since the start of the lockdown, the couple, both soloists in the legendary troupe, have largely used their own initiative to keep up their dance skills at home. Yet Tsvirko and Shrainer still look toned and Tsvirko pulls at his waistband. “I don’t think I’ve got fat, that’s the main thing,” says the 30-year-old dancer, a leading soloist at the Bolshoi who has performed lead roles in “Ivan the Terrible” and “Nureyev”. Shrainer, a first soloist who has performed major roles in “Coppelia” and “Carmen Suite”, massages her leg with a tennis ball and moves into the splits. Together for more than a year, they are living in a studio flat owned by the theatre. The same block is home to several other dancers and it was outside this building that the notorious acid attack on then-artistic director Sergei Filin took place in 2013. Their Zoom class is led by a teacher doing steps in his bedroom to a piano accompaniment. Mexico’s health ministry reported 1,349 new known coronavirus cases and 89 more deaths on Saturday, bringing the country’s total to 22,088 cases and 2,061 deaths. The head of Mexico’s consumer protection agency, Ricardo Sheffield, said on Twitter on Saturday he had tested positive, becoming at least the second high-ranking federal government official with the virus. China reported two new coronavirus cases for 2 May, up from one the day before, data from the country’s national health authority showed on Sunday. One case was imported and the other was local, the National Health Commission (NHC) said. This compares to one imported case and no domestic transmissions on 1 May. The NHC also reported 12 asymptomatic cases for May 2, down from 20 the day before. The number of confirmed cases in China has reached 82,877. With no new deaths reported, the death toll remained at 4,633. AFP has this equine report from Germany: Every morning white mare Jenny leaves her stable to stroll through her Frankfurt neighbourhood. Bringing trams to a halt and smiles to people’s faces, the free-roaming horse is brightening up the coronavirus lockdown for many. “Everyone else has to live with coronavirus restrictions but Jenny is as free as ever,” her owner Anna Weischedel, 65, told AFP. For more than a decade Jenny has wandered solo through her local Fechenheim area, a green part of Frankfurt on the bank of the Main river. She explores the high street, trots along the tram line to a nearby field and spends hours nibbling on patches of grass. The beloved Arabian mare, already a venerable 25 years old, has always been a hit with residents. But never more so than in recent weeks. Like many countries, Germany has closed schools, playgrounds and many businesses to curb the outbreak. Though it has slowly started easing some lockdown measures, people are encouraged to limit their social interactions and keep their distance. Why is Australia’s Covid commission backing a fertiliser plant as its top recovery project? When the Daily Telegraph reported last week that a fertiliser plant in Narrabri being advanced by a West Australian businessman had topped the list of the projects being promoted by the National Covid Coordination Commission, there was some surprise. Vikas Rambal and Perdaman Chemicals and Fertilisers are not exactly household names, and the controversial Narrabri coal seam gas project – which would provide the cheap gas that the fertiliser project depends on – is yet to be approved by the New South Wales government. The commission considered fertilisers to be one of the biggest opportunities, along with petrochemicals and methanol, the executive chairman of the Covid commission, Nev Power, the former Fortescue Metals chief executive, told the Telegraph. “A cracking idea,” the energy minister, Angus Taylor, told the Telegraph in response to Power’s touting of the Perdaman project. “I like to think of the other side of Covid-19 as being a gas-fired recovery,” Taylor said. Just why Power has chosen to promote this project in his quest to rebuild the nation is unclear. The Guardian’s Toby Helm, Robin McKie and Lin Jenkins report. Fewer than one in five of the British public believe the time is right to consider reopening schools, restaurants, pubs and stadiums. The findings, in a new poll for the Observer, suggest Boris Johnson will struggle to convince people to return their lives to normal if he tries to ease the lockdown soon. The poll by Opinium, taken between Wednesday and Friday last week, found 17% of people think the conditions have been met to consider reopening schools, against 67% who say they have not been, and that they should stay closed. Opposition to reopening restaurants and pubs – and allowing mass gatherings in sports and other stadiums to resume – is even higher. Just 11% of people think the time is right to consider reopening restaurants, while 78% are against. Only 9% believe it would be correct to consider reopening pubs, while 81% are against; 7% say it would be right to allow mass gatherings at sports events or concerts to resume, with 84% against. As warmer weather tempted New Yorkers to come out of quarantine, police dispatched 1,000 officers this weekend to enforce social distancing and a ban on congregating in public spaces, AP reports. Officers set out on foot, bicycles and cars to break up crowds and remind those enjoying the weather of public health restrictions requiring they keep 6 feet away from others. “I believe with the warm weather people will come outside,” Governor Andrew Cuomo said Saturday. “You cant stay indoors all the time. People will come outside and thats great, go for a walk. But respect the social distancing and wear a mask.” The New York City Police Department has made 60 arrests and issued 343 summonses related to social distancing since 16 March. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea issued a stern warning after a series of clashes this week between police officers and members of Orthodox Jewish communities over social distancing. A stark example of non-compliance came Thursday when officers interrupted a crowded funeral procession in Brooklyns Borough Park neighbourhood. Video posted to social media showed officers in protective masks chasing a minivan and shouting at dozens of people marching behind the van to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. On 18 April officers passed out summonses and made arrests at a Bronx parking lot and garage where they found a makeshift nightclub featuring a pool table and bar offering hard liquor and Corona beer, and at a closed Brooklyn barbershop where more than 50 people gathered for a party featuring loud music and gambling. Two days later officers broke up a 4/20 marijuana holiday celebration staged in the vacant third floor of a building in Manhattans Chelsea neighborhood. Dozens of people, some drawn by social media hype about the party, were given summonses for trespassing. China and Australia: how a war of words over coronavirus turned to threats of a trade war Australia and China’s fractious relationship scrapped its way to an unedifying new low this week, with a degenerating dispute emerging, ostensibly, from Australia’s call for an international, independent inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic that has so far killed more than 230,000 people. But China and Australia view this inquiry – amorphous though the proposal still is – as entirely different entities. China sees Australia as frontrunning – yet again in Beijing’s eyes – on an issue deliberately constructed to isolate, condemn and humiliate China. It contends the inquiry is a political witch-hunt, engineered by Washington. From Australia’s perspective, the Chinese response appears a dramatic overreaction to an entirely legitimate international concern to understand the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak. The response appears, to Canberra, like an attempt to deflect responsibility, or worse, to shift blame elsewhere. Relations were already deeply damaged, scarred by a succession of antagonisms that the two countries seem to find easy to accumulate, but far harder to shake: the decision of Australia to exclude Huawei from the 5G network rollout; China’s continued incarceration of Australian pro-democracy writer Yang Hengjun; a dispute over the South China Sea; concerns over Chinese influence in Australian business, economics and politics; continuing allegations of espionage. As countries around the world try to figure out the best way to limit the spread of coronavirus, many are considering some form of contact tracing app. But the methods and level of privacy intrusion vary widely. Here’s what we know about how apps are being rolled out in various countries. ‘How is this possible?’ Researchers grapple with Covid-19’s mysterious mechanism Respiratory physician Dr David Darley says something peculiar happens to a small group of Covid-19 patients on day seven of their symptoms. “Up until the end of that first week, they’re stable,” says Darley, a doctor with Sydney’s St Vincent’s Hospital. “And then suddenly, they have this hyper-inflammatory response. The proteins involved in that inflammation start circulating in the body at high levels.” In these patients, the lungs begin to struggle. Blood pressure lowers. Other organs, including the kidneys, may begin to shut down. Blood clots form throughout the body. The brain and intestines may also be affected. Some suffer changes to their personality, suggesting brain damage. Darley is one of the researchers working on a long-term St Vincent’s study of patients admitted to the hospital with Covid-19. Patients will be followed for a year after being discharged, receiving tests at regular intervals to see if there are any lasting effects or changes in the body’s immune system and blood. They will also be assessed for any ongoing changes to lung, gut and brain functions. No one yet knows if the virus causes permanent or long-term harm. The spread of the coronavirus in India’s notoriously crowded prisons has prompted authorities to impose jail lockdowns and release thousands of pretrial detainees on parole, as health experts worry that the cramped facilities are serving as breeding grounds for the disease, PA media reports. Although there are no official numbers on how many inmates have been infected by the virus, Indias correction facilities are slowly recording more infections and have temporarily banned visitors. On Thursday, authorities locked down Nagpur Central Jail in coastal Maharashtra, among the Indian states worst hit by the pandemic. It was the eighth prison in Maharashtra to be locked down. The move came after 19 inmates in Indore Central Jail in central Madhya Pradesh state tested positive for the virus on Tuesday. Around 250 others who came in contact with them were shifted to a temporary jail. Boris Johnson has revealed that doctors prepared to announce his death as he battled coronavirus in hospital last month. The UK Prime Minister spent three nights in intensive care at St Thomas’ in London with the disease. He told the Sun On Sunday: “They had a strategy to deal with a ‘death of Stalin’-type scenario. “The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong.” Mr Johnson, 55, said it was “hard to believe” his health had deteriorated in just a few days, saying he “couldn’t understand why I wasn’t getting better”. The PM told the paper the “indicators kept going in the wrong direction” and that he kept asking himself: “How am I going to get out of this?” “The bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. “That was when it got a bit ... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally.” He said he was “in denial” initially about how serious his illness was, and that doctors were right to “force” him to go to hospital. After a fortnight convalescing from the virus, and just two days after he returned to work full-time, his fiancee Carrie Symonds gave birth to their son, Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson. YouTube has deleted conspiracy theorist David Icke’s account. The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus. The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network. The video service, which is owned by Google, told the BBC: “YouTube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid-19 as described by the WHO and the NHS. “Due to continued violation of these policies we have terminated David Icke’s YouTube channel.” The ban follows a similar move by Facebook, which removed Icke’s page on Friday. Here is the full story on European leaders joining forces to combat Covid-19 Writing in the Independent newspaper, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Norway and senior EU officials said the outbreak had “caused devastation and pain in all corners of the world”. They said responding to the “global challenge” required “bringing together the world’s best – and most prepared – minds to find the vaccines, treatments and therapies we need to make our world healthy again”. This would accompany “strengthening the health systems that will make them available for all, with a particular attention to Africa”. The politicians declared their support for the World Health Organisation (WHO) and backed the recent launch of the “Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator”. The “global cooperation platform” aims to accelerate research, development, access and distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine and other treatments, the leaders wrote, adding that it has “laid the foundation for a real international alliance to fight Covid-19”.

As European countries ease restrictions, France has proposed a minimum 14-day quarantine on anyone arriving in the country from abroad after the end of lockdown on 11 May – a measure similar to that in place in Australia. The measure is included in a new law extending the state of “health emergency” until June 24 to be presented to the French parliament from Monday. European leaders, meanwhile, will hold an online pledging conference on Monday, in an effort to make up a global funding “shortfall” estimated by the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB) – an independent monitoring and accountability body that ensures preparedness for global health crises – and others. European leaders join forces to combat Covid-19. European leaders have pledged to raise billions of pounds to help find a vaccine and treatments for Covid-19 as part of an “international alliance” fighting the disease. An online pledging conference due to be held on Monday will aim to pull in €7.5bn (£6.6bn) in funding to support the global response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Mexicans protest lack of information outside hospital. Families in a city just outside Mexico’s capital demanded news about their relatives who have coronavirus, and urged for the return of the bodies of the dead, after videos showed corpses inside the Las Americas general hospital in Ecatepec, which is among the Mexican municipalities worst-affected by the the virus. Primary schools in England and Wales could reopen for all in June. Children aged five to 11 could return to school from Monday 1 June as part of government plans to gradually ease lockdown measures, the Sunday Telegraph has reported. Italy reports surge in deaths but figure is misleading. Reported coronavirus deaths in Italy rose by 474, after 269 new fatalities were recorded on Friday, but the figures were distorted by late registrations of 282 hospital deaths which had occurred in April, according to La Repubblica newspaper. The daily tally of new infections nationwide was broadly stable for a third day running at 1,900 against 1,965 on Friday. Malaysian authorities have rounded up and detained hundreds of undocumented migrants, including Rohingya refugees, as part of efforts to contain coronavirus, officials said.

About 180 migrants rescued at sea and held in isolation on an Italian ferry off the coast of Sicily will be disembarked in Palermo on Monday, AFP reports, citing the Avvenire daily. UK death toll rises further. Another 621 people are confirmed to have died from the virus in the UK, bringing the total to 28,131 – just short of Italy which has so far had the world’s second most deadly outbreak after the US – as criticism mounts over the government in London’s handling of the crisis in the early stages. Spain eases lockdown as people emerge to exercise. As of first thing Saturday, adults across Spain are allowed to exercise between 6am and 10am and then 8pm til 11pm, while the children’s slot is midday til 7pm.

The Football Safety Officers Association, whose members are employed by clubs and, in many cases, would normally be responsible for drafting up-to-date stadium-risk assessments, say they are concerned that clubs seem to be preparing to return to training while many safety officers have either been furloughed or are working from home because of the coronavirus pandemic. The FSOA fears that inadequate planning could result in tragedy, especially at lower league level, and that safety officers may be held liable despite having been unable to make plans as carefully as they would usually have done. “The role of the safety officer appears to be lost in the current Project Restart negotiations,” said Peter Houghton, the FSOA’s director of operation. “Our concerns in relation to our members and colleagues are that many clubs are pressing on in the restart direction while safety officers have been furloughed or are working from home. It has not left them in the best place to be assessing the risks involved around their stadium while it is closed down. Clubs should not resume with out-of-date assessments and a safety officer cannot do a risk assessment from memory alone, especially not when faced with something that we have never dealt with before.” Premier League clubs will meet again this week to attempt to find a way to complete the season, although matches will only be allowed to go ahead with approval from police, the club doctor, and the public body that issues licences for stadium safety (the Sports Ground Safety Association). But the FSOA says that is not enough, as safety officers usually devise tailor-made risk-assessments and contingency plans for in and around stadiums and training grounds. Such assessments need to be updated to take account of risks associated with the coronavirus, with arrangements needing to be made for disinfection, physical distancing and contingency measures in the event of groups gathering outside grounds. John Newsham, a FSOA consultant and its former chairman, wrote to nearly 350 safety officers, including those at all league clubs, asking for details about their current working arrangements. Only 33 replied, six from Premier League clubs. “I got a lot of automatic out of office replies,” said Newsham, who has drafted a risk analysis to guide members “A lot of safety officers cannot even access their club emails at the moment. From ones I have spoken to, many say there has not been enough consultation. “I’m not saying it’s impossible to resume the season but there needs to be a lot more input before leagues decide, ‘OK, let’s go on June 6 or whatever,’” added Newsham. “Even matches behind closed doors at neutral venues need careful consideration. There are big decisions that have to be made and the right safety officers have to be in the right places so they can make sure they’ve got the risk assessment right. That’s not happening as far as we know.” Houghton said he is particularly concerned about the prospect of lower league teams returning to training and playing. “Many safety officers outside the Premier League and most of the Championship are not full-time. If there is a lawsuit as a result of tragedy befalling a matchday operative or even a footballer, how fair is it for the safety officer to be taken to court and prosecuted as a result of a risk he didn’t think the club should take, but which a competition provider or national governing body has decided is acceptable?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/live/2020/may/03/coronavirus-us-latest-updates-donald-trump-anthony-fauci-nancy-pelosi-deaths","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-03T17:42:31Z","webTitle":"Coronavirus US live: Cuomo says ‘government essential to human life’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/03/coronavirus-us-latest-updates-donald-trump-anthony-fauci-nancy-pelosi-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2020/may/03/coronavirus-us-latest-updates-donald-trump-anthony-fauci-nancy-pelosi-deaths","fields":{"headline":"Coronavirus US live: Cuomo says ‘government essential to human life’","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/dndyy","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/784632569f20ecf4bb264127f98a8c3b79152cd1/0_283_5568_3341/500.jpg","bodyText":"The Guardian’s Kenya Evelyn reports on how some New Yorkers are calling foul on the city’s enforcement of stay-at-home restrictions. Community advocates across New York’s Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn boroughs have called out city and state officials or what they claim are racial and ethnic double standards in its application of social distancing orders. Images of wealthier, white residents in Manhattan disregarding stay-at-home orders in neighborhood parks have gone viral throughout much of the weekend. But many residents have said that so far, it is neighborhoods in the city’s less affluent communities that have been targeted for ticketing and arrests. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio was forced to apologize this week for personally overseeing the dispersal of a Hasidic Jewish funeral in Brooklyn on Wednesday after lashing out at the conduct of mourners. But crowds in Manhattan gathered that same day to watch a city flyover by the US navy’s Blue Angels and the air force’s Thunderbirds planes in honor of healthcare workers. “Only bigots have a problem when a few 100 Hasidim do what thousands of people in the same city have done the same day: not social distance,” the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council tweeted. The mayor’s actions renewed focus from community leaders on the city’s unequal application of stay-at-home orders, especially as other groups have also been violating restrictions without consequence. While social distancing is meant to curb the spread, health experts say racial disparities have influenced the outbreak from the beginning. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention testing requirements, including recent foreign travel, meant that guidelines skewed heavily affluent and white in early weeks. That meant low-income, mostly black and brown areas of Brooklyn, Bronx and Queens were not tested as quickly, leading to the city’s stark racial disparities among cases. More than 18,500 people have died in the city, with nearly two-thirds being black or Latino. New York state’s mandatory stay-at-home order expires 15 May but is expected to be extended. More on the Joe Biden-Tara Reade story. The presumptive Democratic nominee is accused by his former staffer of sexually assaulting her in 1993. Biden denies the claim, while Reade has disputed an Associated Press report which says she did not describe a sexual assault or harassment on the complaint she says she filed 27 years ago. She has also reportedly received threats. On CNN earlier, Michigan governor and potential Biden running mate Gretchen Whitmer had an instructive exchange, considering the dynamics of the issue as Democrats defend Biden and Republicans, including party chair Ronna McDaniel, attack. Jake Tapper: “You have said that you believe Vice-President Biden. I want to compare that to 2018, when you said you believed Dr Christine Blasey Ford after she accused now (supreme court) justice Brett Kavanaugh of assault. Kavanaugh also, like Biden, categorically denied that accusation. And Blasey Ford, to be honest, she did not have the contemporaneous accounts of her view of what happened that Tara Reade does. “You have spoken movingly about how you’re a survivor of assault yourself. Why do you believe Biden, and not Kavanaugh? Are they not both entitled to the same presumption of innocence, regardless of their political views? Whitmer: “You know, Jake, as a survivor and as a feminist, I will say this. We need to give people an opportunity to tell their story. But then we have a duty to vet it. And just because you’re a survivor doesn’t mean that every claim is equal. It means we give them the ability to make their case, and the other side as well, and then to make a judgment that is informed. “I have read a lot about this current allegation. I know Joe Biden, and I have watched his defense. And there’s not a pattern that goes into this. And I think that, for these reasons, I’m very comfortable that Joe Biden is who he says he is. And you know what? And that’s all I’m going to say about it. “I really resent the fact that, every time a case comes up, all of us survivors have to weigh in. It is reopening wounds … take us at our word, ask us for our opinion, and let’s move on. Tapper: “Well, just for the record, the reason I’m asking you is because you’re the only Democrat on the show today, not because you’re a survivor, and not because you’re a woman.” Whitmer said she was not criticising Tapper, but “just sharing, I think, some of the simmering anger that we survivors have every time that we have got to confront this from someone else’s behavior that we weren’t a party to, that we weren’t even a part of the reality in the moment. “What I think is this. We owe it to every woman who has a story to listen to that story, and then to vet that story, ask the questions and be critical thinkers, and then make a judgment, based on all of those pieces. I have done that in this instance. “And I will tell you this. I don’t believe that it’s consistent with the Joe Biden that I know. And I do believe Joe, and I support Joe Biden.” Cuomo says “people expect more from government than ever before” and discusses the “transformative” effective of this pandemic. “I believe this has been transformative for a generation,” he says. “Think about when was the last time government was this vital. I don’t know, maybe in a war? World War II, when government had to mobilize overnight? But literally for decades you haven’t seen government this essential to human life. Literally. And government has to work and it has to work well, and it’s not for the faint of heart. And people want government to perform. And government is making decisions every day that affect their lives and they deserve the best government. They’re paying for it, they deserve it. And they deserve competence and expertise and smarts and for government to be doing creative things and learning like we doing here today.” The New York governor then goes on to stress the importance of individual responsibility in the ongoing fight, reiterating the necessity of social distancing. “An individual’s role is responsibly and intelligently for yourself for your family and for your community,” he says. “You want to honor the healthcare workers and the people who literally gave their lives in some cases for what they did here? Act responsibly. Wear a mask. I know the weather is getting warmer, I know people want to get out of the house. Fine. Wear a mask and socially distance. That is your social responsibility in the middle of this overall pandemic. And when we talk about New Yorkers together and the spirit of unity and how people are helping one another and how tough we are and how smart we are and how disciplined we are and how we love one other? Show it. You know how you show love? By wearing a mask.” After noting that New York state has spent more than $2 billion on medical equipment this year alone, Cuomo announces the formation of a regional buying consortium with seven neighboring states to “increase market power and bring down prices” in the pursuit of PPE, ventilators and other medical equipment. The governor says the mutual-aid agreement “will make us more competitive in the international marketplace and I believe it will save taxpayers money”. “We will come up with a regional identification of all the equipment we need,” Cuomo says. “Let’s come up with the total amount that we need. Let’s stop doing business with vendors we found to be irresponsible and we found out the hard way – I can’t tell you how many orders we placed with vendors who are acting basically as brokers, who just started businesses in the middle of this pandemic because they saw an opportunity – so let’s compare notes among the states to find out who is good to do business with [and] who was not good to do business with. Let’s see if we can’t do the purchasing in this country and let’s see if we can’t do the purchasing in this region. Why we buying all this material from China? “ New York governor Andrew Cuomo says the number of current Covid-19 hospitalizations statewide has dropped below 10,000 for the first time since mid-March in his daily coronavirus briefing from Albany. The number of new hospitalizations over the last 24-hour period has also fallen to 789, though Cuomo warns this could be an anomaly. Cuomo says 280 people died yesterday, lifting the total death toll to 19,189. “The overall direction is good even though it’s very painful,” Cuomo says. Tara Reade, the woman who accuses Joe Biden of sexually assaulting her in a Capitol Hill corridor in 1993, has disputed an Associated Press report that said she said she did not use the words “sexual harassment” in a complaint she says she filed 27 years ago. The AP report is here. Reade’s tweets on the matter are here. “This is false,” Reade wrote first, adding later: “…The headline was quite misleading. I filed the intake form regarding sexual harassment and retaliation however that was articulated on form in 1993. I filed with Senate Personnel. Perhaps Joe Biden knows where that form is located. Ask him.” Reade also confirmed a report she had cancelled a Fox News Sunday interview after receiving threats, writing: “No survivor be fearful to come forward. And I did file a complaint.” In a statement and TV interview on Friday, Biden flatly denied the accusation and asked the National Archives to look for Reade’s complaint. The Archive said it wouldn’t have it, but the Senate might. Donald Trump, who faces and denies numerous accusations of sexual misconduct and assault, commented on the claim against Biden on Friday, as did his new press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Here’s Lauren Gambino’s excellent look at the story and its political implications for both parties: Democrats have been accused of brushing aside an allegation of sexual assault against Joe Biden from former Senate staffer Tara Reade. Reade says the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate assaulted her in 1993. On ABC’s This Week, the chair of the DNC, Tom Perez, defended Biden. “Joe Biden has been very clear that this did not happen,” Perez said on Sunday. “He was forceful in that, and he’s been equally clear that when women come forward with complaints of this nature, they should be taken seriously, their complaints should investigate, they should be treated with dignity, and he’s done exactly that. He called for the Senate to release any documents they have, she indicated that she filed a complaint. Joe Biden wants that complaint released. He is an open book. He understands that it’s important for the information to get out.” Perez also attacked Donald Trump’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. “This president has been chronically inept at handling this coronavirus,” said Perez. “We have less than 5% of the world’s population. We have one-third of the world’s coronavirus cases and 25 % of the world’s deaths from coronavirus. His inattention, his ineptitude, he needs to be the commander in chief, not the Tweeter in chief. He needs to understand that the buck stops with him. And that’s what we’re going to talk about in this campaign, accountability, we’re going to talk about leadership.” It’s World Press Freedom Day today and Donald Trump has chosen to mark it by saying he welcomes the important role the media plays in holding the powerful to account. Or maybe he went on Twitter to attack journalists as “the Enemy of the People”. “The Fake News doesn’t show real polls. Lamestream Media is totally CORRUPT, the Enemy of the People!” he wrote on Twitter this morning, as he highlighted a Gallup poll that shows he has the highest approval rating of his presidency so far. CNN’s Brian Stelter contrasted Trump’s tweet with messages of support for the media from the leaders of Greece, Namibia, Lithuania and the Maldives. “The pandemic, breaking with the rules of our everyday life, reaffirms in the most unequivocal manner the vital role of the free press in offering citizens accurate and valid information,” wrote Katerina Sakellaropoulou, the president of Greece on Twitter on Sunday. More on China and North Korea from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has been speaking to ABC. “I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan,” Pompeo said, when asked about Trump’s claim this week to have seen intelligence confirming the theory that Covid-19 was man-made and did not originate in bats and find its way to humans via a “wet market”, as is generally accepted. He did not, of course, say what the evidence was. Pompeo added: “The best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point.” Then the exchange with This Week host Martha Raddatz got confusing, as to what Pompeo does or does not think. This is from ABC’s transcript: RADDATZ: Your Office of the [Director of National Intelligence] says the consensus, the scientific consensus [is that the virus] was not man-made or genetically modified. POMPEO: That’s right. I agree with that. Yeah. I’ve seen their analysis. I’ve seen the summary that you saw that was released publicly. I have no reason to doubt that that is accurate... (CROSSTALK) RADDATZ: OK, so just to be clear, you do not think it was man-made or genetically modified? POMPEO: I’ve seen what the intelligence community has said. I have no reason to believe that they’ve got it wrong. Um… Pompeo continued to attack China for its handling of the outbreak and what he said was a delay in transmitting information to the rest of the world. So far, so in line with White House attempts to blame China and thereby shift attention or blame from its own stumbling response as the US situation worsened throughout February and March. Raddatz asked “Do you think they intentionally released that virus or it was an accident in the lab?” “You know,” Pompeo said, “I don’t have anything to say about that. I think there’s a lot to know. But I can say this. We’ve done our best to try and answer all of those questions. We tried to get a team in there. The World Health Organization tried to get a team in there. And they have failed. No one’s been allowed to go to this lab or any of the other laboratories – there are many labs inside of China, Martha. This risk remains.” The chair of the Republican National Committee Chair, Ronna McDaniel, appeared on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos where she was asked about allegations from Tara Reade, a former Senate staffer, that she was sexually assaulted by Joe Biden in 1993. McDaniel accused Democrats and the media of hypocrisy over the allegations, saying Biden had been treated lightly, compared to the scrutiny given to Brett Kavanaugh when allegations of sexual assault were levelled against him before his appointment to the supreme court. “It has been appalling, the hypocrisy, as to how Brett Kavanaugh was treated versus Joe Biden,” said McDaniel. “Brett Kavanaugh, every accuser was put on TV. It was wall-to-wall coverage. They went into his high school year book. They said he needed an FBI investigation ... And then you go to Joe Biden. Five weeks of silence. Nineteen interviews without a single question. He won’t let people go into his records in the University of Delaware. They’re calling on the DNC to do the investigation. “It went from MeToo, MeToo, MeToo, to Move on, Move on, Move on in a nanosecond because he’s a Democrat and the hypocrisy is appalling and it’s not just from the Democrats, it’s from the media, and I’ll tell you, I think any outlet that conducted those 19 interviews and didn’t ask a single question should be disqualified from conducting any part of a presidential debate.” Biden, has in fact, been asked about the allegations, most recently on Friday on MSNBC. Various publications, including the Guardian, have also discussed the claims. The New York Times editorial board has called on the DNC to conduct an independent review of the matter. Meanwhile, Donald Trump, who has also been accused of sexual assault, appeared to be sympathetic to Biden, who he is almost certain to face in this year’s presidential election. In an interview on Friday, Trump said: “I would just say to Joe Biden, just go out and fight [the allegation]”. McDaniel said the president made his comments because he believes in justice. “Because due process and the presumption of innocence has no longer been the standard in this country when it comes to Republicans and now Democrats are suddenly embracing those legal standards that we made the cornerstone of our country when it comes to Joe Biden, but they threw it out the window when it came to Brett Kavanaugh, and so did the media,” she said. McDaniel also said she was not worried about polls showing that Trump trails Biden in several key states. “I think the American people recognize what a strong leader he has been through this unprecedented crisis,” she said. Maryland governor Larry Hogan, a Republican not exactly on Donald Trump’s good side, most of the time, also spoke to CNN this morning. He admonished Kudlow’s comments about further economic aid to states possibly being linked to policy priorities such as clamping down on undocumented migrants, blaming Democrats in the House, Republicans in the Senate and the White House for indulging in “divisive politics” when “it’s time to get something done”. Hogan famously did get something done, flying in 500,000 coronavirus tests from South Korea – Hogan’s wife is Korean, which helped – and then guarding them at a secret location to stop the federal government from swooping and taking the tests for itself. Remarkably enough, Hogan confirmed to CNN that he had been worried the Trump administration would steal his tests, although he said the worry was not so strong now. Hogan was also asked about anti-lockdown protests in his state, including a speech on Saturday from Andy Harris, a Republican congressman who said he “did not wake up in Communist China or North Korea” and demanded his right to attend church if he wished. “I think everyone has a right to protest,” Hogan said. “A couple dozen did so yesterday and … sadly we had far more people die yesterday in Maryland than we did protesters. Congressman Harris, I’m not sure where he woke up yesterday morning … he’s obviously got the right to say whatever crazy things he wants to say.” The Johns Hopkins figures for Maryland: 24,473 cases and 1,251 deaths. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer appeared on CNN’s State of the Union, for an interview subject to a particularly glitchy feed from Zoom, Skype or whichever video service was being used, making her look at times a bit like she was wearing first world war “dazzle” camouflage. Our leaders are subject to the same trials of working from home as the rest of us, evidently, if not quite so eager to show off that they did an MA in British modern art. Whitmer was asked about the protest in her state capital, Lansing, on Thursday in which men armed with “long guns” participated – carrying them legally, it should be noted, in the statehouse. “We know that people are not all happy about having to take the stay home posture,” she said, “and you know what, I’m not either. But we have to listen to the public health experts and displays like the one we saw in our state capital are not representative of who we are in Michigan. “There were swastikas and Confederate flags and nooses and people with assault rifles. That’s a small group of people when you think that this is a state of almost 10m people, the vast majority of whom are doing the right thing.” Donald Trump has regularly expressed support for the Michigan protesters, who on Friday he called “very good people”, inviting comparisons to his infamous comments about the Charlottesville white supremacists and neo-Nazis who marched in the summer of 2017. (They were “very fine people”, for the inglorious record.) Asked about the president’s comments, Whitmer said: “Some of the outrageousness of what happened in our capital this week depicted some of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country. Now, the Confederate flags and nooses, the swastikas, the behaviour that you’ve seen, is not representative of who we are in Michigan.” In other words, she chose not to shout back at the president, or comment on his suggestion she should “make a deal” with such protesters. Whitmer was also asked about her support for Joe Biden, Trump’s presumptive challenger in November, who is accused of sexual assault and who might also name Whitmer as his running mate. More on that to come. Ohio’s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, appeared on ABC News’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos this morning to talk about his decision to make a phased reopening of businesses in his state. The manufacturing and construction sector will reopen on Monday before retail businesses come back on 12 May. Zoos, amusement parks and sports stadiums will remain closed until further notice. DeWine said that while he was keenly aware the world is in the middle of a pandemic, he wanted to balance safety measures with personal freedom. “I think generally Republicans are less inclined to have the government tell them what to do,” he said. “And that’s generally how I am. I’m a conservative Republican.” That philosophy may well have played into DeWine’s decision to reverse an order mandating that customers should wear face masks when shopping. “People were not going to accept the government telling them what to do,” said DeWine, who added that retail workers would still need to wear masks. “We put out dozens and dozens of orders, that was one that it just went too far. But at the same time we pulled that back, I said ... I highly recommend [wearing masks] ... Unless you have a physical reason you can’t wear the mask, and we understand that, but when you go into a retail store, that is the kind thing to do because I worry and we should all worry about the folks who are stocking shelves in grocery stores, the people who are [on] the check-out line who work there all day, and we got to try to protect them.” DeWine also stopped short of saying he would issue another stay-at-home order if cases started to rise after the reopening. “We’re going to watch numbers every single day,” he said. “And we’re going to communicate those numbers to the people of Ohio. That’s one of the things we’ve done. We do a press conference virtually every day and we try to give them the data that we’re looking at. So if we’re starting to see those numbers, the people of the state are going to see those numbers and we’ll have to take action. But what I hope is as people see those numbers, if they do go up and if they go up dramatically, that the people of the state will react to that. “We keep saying we’re all in this together and that’s the way I look at it as far as my job as governor and the people of the state. I got to keep them informed of what’s going on. I think they’ll do the right thing once they know the facts.” More than 1,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Ohio so far. From a White House economic adviser to a White House public health adviser: Dr Deborah Birx is talking on Fox News Sunday: She’s referring to protesters who want state economies and societies reopened, and who have been seen in states across the US. Here’s an AP intro that sums up rather neatly the tensions between such demands and governors and experts who think reopening too quickly will most likely prove deadly: Hundreds opposed to Oregon’s stay-at-home order demonstrated at the state capitol on Saturday as health officials announced dozens more cases and five additional deaths from Covid-19. Relative to California and Washington state, for two nearby examples, Oregon has not been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus: the Johns Hopkins figures put cases there at 2,635 and deaths at 109. The protests there on Saturday were not as angry as those in Michigan, for example, this week, where armed men entered the statehouse, frightening lawmakers … and earning the support of the president. Nonetheless, the AP continues, “protest organizers [said] they view the social distancing mandates issued by Governor Kate Brown as government overreach. Since mid-March, Brown’s orders have closed many businesses, put some parks and campgrounds off limits, and required public schools to adopt distance learning programs. “Most of the protesters did not wear face masks, but they waved American flags and Trump campaign signs in the rain. Other signs read ‘Reopen Oregon’ and ‘Let me earn a living.’ “A group of healthcare workers demonstrated at the top of the Capitol steps, urging a phased plan to ease the state’s social distancing requirements. Most of the other protesters ignored them. “You can’t just place citizens under house arrest and enforce those orders,” event organizer Adam Ellifritt said. Here’s some video of the Michigan protests: White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow is up on CNN’s State of the Union, discussing the economy and how to get it going again with a pandemic still raging, as more than half of the 50 states are now attempting to do. Kudlow mentions that further aid may be coming for struggling Americans, with almost 30m unemployed, and also floats again the idea that the Trump administration may try to tie it to such moves as concessions on sanctuary cities, mostly Democratic-run places which do not co-operate with attempts to remove undocumented migrants. Many observers have pointed out tying aid to policy priorities like that would be unprecedented and, to some, unconscionable. Kudlow also predicts a “potentially strong springback” from state economies, and saying 2021 could “be one of the fastest growth rebounds in US history”. The economy is central to Trump’s case for re-election, of course. Here’s Robert Reich again on that: Kudlow is asked about disconnects between public health advisers who counsel caution on reopening and economic advisers, such as him, who say it is time to reopen. He defends his own previous remarks about the coronavirus being contained. Obviously. The virus has “spread exponentially in ways no one could’ve predicted”, he says, which epidemiologists and others would and do contest. Also obviously. Oh, and Maine: Maine is a state not yet so badly hit – Johns Hopkins figures put it at a little more than 1,150 cases and 56 deaths. But here’s Lauren Aratani with a more, uh, considered take on the problems facing a state dependent on summer tourism… Trump has also tweeted about how he misses his rallies: Hopefully our Country will soon mend. We are all missing our wonderful rallies, and many other things!” Many people thought Trump was using his daily White House coronavirus briefings as rally substitutes, pounding out misinformation and attacks on familiar enemies with a captive national audience. Then the president used the podium (or lectern, Twitter pedants, a line I now have on shortcut) to suggest people might inject themselves with disinfectant to beat the coronavirus and that alley was, for now, in the main, closed off too. It’s also worth remembering that the president has often claimed not to have left the White House during the pandemic other than to visit a hospital ship leaving Virginia for New York, when in fact he staged rallies and visited the CDC in Atlanta. Trump is currently at Camp David in Maryland. There is no White House briefing on the schedule but he does have a Fox News town hall at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington tonight, at 9pm ET. Donald Trump is awake and – in Withnailian terms I can’t resist and initiates of the film will get, Curse of the Superman and all that – he’s stepped back into society and started tossing his orb about. One target this morning: President George W Bush, who has called for Americans to put partisanship aside during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump says Bush was “nowhere to be found” when his Republican successor was impeached, and thereby failed to “speak up against the greatest Hoax in American history!” Also in the firing line, on Saturday night, was MSNBC host Nicole Wallace. It turns out I’m right to think a double dog is a yoga pose, but in Trumpian tweet trash talk terms it’s the following: “She was thrown off The View like a dog, Zero T.V. Personas. Now Wallace is a 3rd rate lapdog for Fake News MSDNC (Concast). Doesn’t have what it takes!” Nice to see he’s using his time constructively. On Saturday night, Trump also claimed to have done more for African Americans than any president, although Honest Abe” – Lincoln, who ended slavery, remember – “wasn’t bad”. He also said of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un “I, for one, am glad to see he is back, and well!”, earning predictable rebukes for praising a dictator. To Sunday morning: Trump has already attacked “the Fake News” and “the Lamestream Media” about polls, of course he has, and he has also retweeted a message which ends “Jeffrey Epstein didn’t kill himself.” That one, by the by, is from the same failed congressional candidate who’s “#FireFauci” tweet Trump retweeted last month, causing widespread consternation. It’s fun, keeping up with Trump tweets. Really, it is. …and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus – and politics – in the US. First, as ever, the figures from Johns Hopkins University: US cases: 1,132,903 US deaths: 66,380 New York cases: 312,977 New York deaths: 24,198 Other states are badly hit: New Jersey is approaching 8,000 deaths, Michigan’s toll has passed 4,000. And states with governors looking to reopen their economies faster than might be wise are affected too: there have been more than 35,000 cases and more than 1,300 deaths in Florida, for example, where the Grim Reaper himself, sort of, is patrolling the beaches in protest. In Washington, or near it at Camp David, Donald Trump continues to stir the pot. The Senate is due back in session on Monday – Mitch McConnell has judges to confirm, among other business – despite the dangers to its distinctly aging population. Trump has been busy slamming Nancy Pelosi, 80, for not reopening the House. It’s worth noting that Pelosi and McConnell together, a rare sight, turned down Trump’s offer of accelerated testing for members of Congress. Also, the White House has blocked Dr Anthony Fauci from testifying before a House committee about the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus crisis. This is one that’s going to rumble on. In a tweet on Saturday night, Trump said: “The Democrats are just, as always, looking for trouble. They do nothing constructive, even in times of crisis. They don’t want to blame their cash cow, China, for the plague. China is blaming Europe. Dr Fauci will be testifying before the Senate very soon!” Republicans control the Senate, although Fauci has a history of contradicting Trump or reportedly angering him by sticking to inconvenient facts whatever the venue for doing so. We’ll be watching this one as the morning shows roll on. There’s also mounting Democratic anger about Trump’s moves to neuter oversight of his administration, most recently by removing a health watchdog who wrote a report critical of the first responses to and preparations for the arrival of Covid-19. Elizabeth Warren: “When it comes to his handling of this pandemic, Donald Trump has a view on oversight: He doesn’t want any. Make no mistake: We will keep doing our jobs and holding him accountable for his botched response to a national crisis.” All that and more to come, you lucky, lucky readers. Before it does, here’s our columnist Robert Reich with an elegant evisceration of the Trump administration’s moves to reopen the US economy…"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/may/03/covid-19-has-put-cancer-patients-and-research-at-huge-risk","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-03T17:21:04Z","webTitle":"Covid-19 has put cancer patients and research at huge risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/covid-19-has-put-cancer-patients-and-research-at-huge-risk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/may/03/covid-19-has-put-cancer-patients-and-research-at-huge-risk","fields":{"headline":"Covid-19 has put cancer patients and research at huge risk","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/dn9jz","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1429bb0c2ec93db08afba871c066adbe5660b12/0_130_5760_3456/500.jpg","bodyText":"As a cancer surgeon for 30 years, I have never witnessed a decline in referrals such as over the last month (Coronavirus crisis could lead to 18,000 more cancer deaths, experts warn, 29 April). Too many patients are missing out on the care they need and there is a backlog building up that threatens to overwhelm us. While support for the NHS is strong, that may change if it becomes apparent that non-Covid-19 patients have been neglected. Medical research has also been hit. Labs have been closed and trials suspended. Research budgets have been cut and hard-won progress set back years. Cancer Research UK, which funds half of all research into the disease, is facing a huge blow to its income. Its shops are closed, events have had to be cancelled and gifts from well-wishers have dwindled. It has already been forced to cut its support for research by £44m, and, without government help, more cuts may be in the pipeline. This is disastrous for the future of medicine.

Deborah Buchanan, from Newtownabbey in County Antrim, said she was asked by her mother, Joan Wright, 75, to take the photo last week in what were some of the last words she uttered. A Facebook post by Buchanan featured the photo, taken at Furness general hospital, Cumbria, showing her mother in bed and with family members around her, dressed in personal protective equipment (PPE). They included Buchanan’s father, who she said was still in hospital. Wright died with her husband holding her hand and with other family members by her side. “We had to watch her gasp her last breaths and slip away in agony,” Buchanan wrote in the post, which has been shared more than 4,000 times. “My dad says this is the worst thing he has ever felt in his life, he fears going to sleep in case he doesn’t wake up. They hadn’t left the house in weeks but still picked this up and both took very unwell. My dad is still in hospital and not out of the woods yet, his heart is broken and he has to continue to fight to try and beat this.” She added: “This is the reality of coronavirus. Wake up and wise up. This is not going away anytime soon and more and more people are going to die. Don’t let it be your parent or grandparent or any member of your family who ends up like this. Stay away from those you love, and protect yourselves and them.” The couple had both tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 April after being admitted to hospital three days earlier. Buchanan said she received a call from the hospital on Wednesday last week asking her to come as soon as possible, and family members were provided with PPE. Buchanan told Northern Ireland’s Sunday Life newspaper that her mother and father had moved to Cumbria 15 years ago to retire. They had been together more than 50 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2020/may/03/two-teenagers-charged-with-murder-nhs-worker-david-gomoh","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-03T17:17:04Z","webTitle":"Two teenagers charged with murder of NHS worker David Gomoh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/03/two-teenagers-charged-with-murder-nhs-worker-david-gomoh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2020/may/03/two-teenagers-charged-with-murder-nhs-worker-david-gomoh","fields":{"headline":"Two teenagers charged with murder of NHS worker David Gomoh","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/dney8","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/a90f7983d5731d9eff2ba4e329c0ed7415bae848/0_263_2046_1227/500.jpg","bodyText":"Two teenagers have been charged with the murder of David Gomoh, the NHS worker killed outside his home in east London, Scotland Yard said. Gomoh, 24, who worked for Barts Health NHS trust in supplies and procurement, was stabbed to death in Newham just days before he was due to attend the funeral of his father, who died from a coronavirus-related illness. Muhammad Jalloh, 18, from Stratford, in Newham, and a 16-year-old boy, from Telford, in Shropshire, were both charged with murder on Sunday. The teenagers were also charged with conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm in connection with an alleged incident against a different person shortly before Gomoh was found stabbed on 26 April. Both will appear at Thames magistrates court on Monday. Gomoh’s mother, Marian, also works for the NHS as a matron at Newham hospital. A fundraising page has been set up by her colleagues to help with the costs of her son’s funeral. A statement on the page reads: “A mother should never have to bury her own child, especially just after the death of her husband. “Sister Marian has helped so many of us in the NHS, she has practised as both a nurse and midwife for over 20 years and is a credit to the service. She is currently matron of labour ward, where she goes above and beyond to support her staff with any problems they present to her. “Her life has been suddenly turned upside down and this is a chance for us to show our support and gratitude.” Gomoh was allegedly attacked in Freemasons Road by a group of four to five males moments after he left his home close to the NHS Nightingale hospital at the ExCel centre at 10.45pm.

To continue following our coronavirus coverage, you can check out our global liveblog NHS England announced 327 further deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of reported deaths in hospitals in England to 21,180. A further 14 people have died after testing positive in Wales, taking the total number of deaths to 983. In Scotland, a further 12 people have died which brings the total to 1,571. There have been a further five confirmed deaths of patients who tested positive for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, bringing the total deaths in the region to 381. The total UK death toll now stands at 28,446. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove reveals 76,496 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning, which is substantially below the 100,000 target it had set. He said the government has pledged an additional £1.6 billion to councils across England to support their “essential frontline services” including adult social care. Gove also suggested the easing of lockdown restrictions will be “staged” and will not be a “flick of the switch”. He added that 90% of rough sleepers known to councils have been given an offer of accommodation since the end of March. Professor Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, insisted the new NHS Nightingale hospitals were “absolutely 100% not” built in error, adding it would have been “foolish” not to plan for extra capacity. Fewer people would have died from coronavirus in the UK if the country had greater testing capacity sooner, transport secretary Grant Shapps said. Asked whether fewer people would have died if testing capacity had been greater sooner, he told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “Yes. If we had had 100,000 test capacity before this thing started and the knowledge that we now have retrospectively I’m sure many things could be different.” Three rail unions have written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, Mark Drakeford, the First Minister of Wales, and Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, saying this is not the time to lift the lockdown and run more trains. The joint letter – signed by the heads of ASLEF, RMT and the TSSA– says it is “completely unacceptable” to put the lives of passengers and rail staff at risk. Police have arrested 13 people and issued 11 more with fines after breaking up two parties in Liverpool. Three officers were assaulted after attending one of the house parties in Garmoyle Road, Wavertree. Eleven people, most who had travelled from Greater Manchester, were issued with fixed penalty notices for breaching Covid-19 legislation yesterday. A 20-year-old woman, from Hyde in Greater Manchester, was arrested on suspicion of breach of Covid-19 legislation and three counts of assaulting constables after becoming aggressive when officers attended. Police were called to Duke Street, in the city centre, in the early hours after suspicions a group had forced entry to a property and were holding a party. Officers arrested four people in the car on suspicion of burglary. Eight more people were arrested on suspicion of burglary after officers attended the property, a police spokesman said. Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at University of Exeter Medical School, on the tracing app. Gove was also challenged about the role of Trevor Phillips in the inquiry over BAME patients, which has been the subject of controversy for his previous remarks about Muslims and his suspension from Labour. He said Phillips, when he was chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Committee, was always “driven by the data”. Gove described Phillips as a “distinguished” public servant. The daily press briefing from Downing Street has now concluded. Gove is asked about the inquiry into the disproportionate impact of coronavirus on BAME people. He replies there “appears to be a significant number of deaths” in the BAME community. He added there may be a greater prevalence of conditions such as diabetes in some communities but another factor may be inequality. But he said he does not want to “prejudge” the inquiry. Prof Powis said the R -rate is around 0.7 but the figure has yet to be finalised. Gove is asked how many prisoners have been released due to the coronavirus outbreak. He replies the early release of prisons was “just one part” of reducing the number of cases in prisons in order to protect the NHS. Gove says pregnant women were at the front of the queue for release. He added at least 33 people had been released but the number is higher now. When asked about his confidence in models predicting what may happen with any change in lockdown rules, Prof Powis said “the reality will always be different from the model, it will not exactly replicate the model” and “there are some unknowns”. He said the public had been “really excellent at complying” with the rules, and thus far trends have tended to follow the models produced. He added: “It’s followed it pretty much in the shape of what we’ve seen so that does give me some confidence that going forward models are a reasonable way of predicting what we might see. “They do predict that over the next month or so we will continue to see a decline in the number of patients in hospital with Covid-19, the number of people in critical care and indeed the number of deaths.” He added: “They will never be an absolute perfect prediction of reality but I have confidence that going forward they will give us a very good guide of what we are likely to see.” Prof Powis has insisted the new NHS Nightingale hospitals were “absolutely 100% not” built in error after reported emerged of a low capacity of patients. He said it would have been “foolish” not to plan for extra capacity in the NHS, and it is “good news” that the Nightingales’ capacity has not been reached. Prof Powis says there is still a possibility they could yet be needed. He suggests the peak of the virus in the UK was around mid-April. Gove says the government plans a “staged” return with ministers working with employers and unions to help workers understand safety guidance and public servants will be offered protective equipment varying “from setting to setting”. He also says it is possible restrictions could be reimposed in a “localised way” but does not go into the specifics. Gove praised health secretary Matt Hancock’s “amazing success in increasing testing”, which he said means the public will have “greater confidence” in the government as they move into the next phase of lockdown. “The British public have shown amazing stoicism and understanding of the need for the lockdown measures,” he said. “Quite rightly they want to make sure that if and when they are eased, they’re eased in way that makes sure the British people’s sacrifice has been worthwhile, and that we continue to operate in a way that means public health comes first. “And that’s why it’s so important that we consult with employers and trade unions, to make sure that people understand the guidance about working safely.” He said the government will pursue a “phased approach” to removing lockdown restrictions rather than a sudden return to “the old normal”. The phrase a “new normal” has again been used. Gove says there will be a time when the virus is under control when “deep and probing questions” about the government’s handling of the crisis can be posed. “Undoubtedly this government, like all governments, will have made mistakes,” he admitted. Further bemused reaction to those daily testing numbers falling below the 100,000 target. Professor Stephen Powis has praised the resilience and professionalism of NHS staff. He said: “What I learned is that the NHS and the great staff of the NHS, when given that challenge, can very, very rapidly put in place the extra capacity that is required. “And they have done that magnificently, and at no point during the surge of cases in April was the NHS in a position where it was not able to give the treatment to patients with Covid-19 that they needed. “That is a great testament to how well the NHS has been able to cope. “And I think then the lesson going forward is one, that we can do that, but two, we need to keep that capacity in place. “But we need to keep it in place at the same time as standing up all the other services that the NHS is providing. “They’re the ones we’ve always provided, the emergency services, but some of the services that we’ve had to stand down during April, so elective surgery for instance. “So my lesson is that the NHS is incredibly flexible. It can respond to this challenge, and it will respond to the challenge going forward into the months ahead.” Gove says there are around 80,000 households on the Isle of Wight, where the NHS contact-tracing app is being trialled, and they want more than half of them to download it. He added the dip in the number of coronavirus tests over the weekend is due to the fact it is the weekend and fewer people are at work. More from Gove on what lessons have been learned for future waves of the virus and how the government will ensure there are enough PPE and ventilators in the future. He said: “We’re learning lessons all the time, as indeed the world is. “This is a new virus and scientists are working internationally to determine what the best means is of dealing with it. “And that’s why we are piloting treatments which can prevent the virus, once people have been infected, becoming more dangerous for them. “It’s also why we’re working internationally to seek to secure a vaccine, though of course we expect that may be some time away. “But one of the things that we have learned is how to improve our testing capacity. “We also now have increased domestic ventilator production and Lord Deighton is increasing domestic PPE production as well. “And I think the lessons that we’re learning in the UK are similar to the lessons that other countries are learning as well.” Gove is asked how the government will persuade people, when the lockdown is eventually eased, that it is safe to leave their homes. He replies that Britons have displayed “stoicism” in the face of the lockdown. He added that the lifting of the lockdown will be “staged” and not a “flick of the switch”, while he highlights how the right supplies of PPE will be necessary. Gove also notes how the “amazing” increase in the level of testing will give people greater confidence when the lockdown is eased. Gove said that 90% of rough sleepers known to councils have been given an offer of accommodation since the end of March. Providing an update on work that was being done to help vulnerable people, he said the Government was nearing delivering its one millionth parcel of essential food. In terms of NHS volunteers, he told the briefing that more than 600,000 people have been verified “and are helping with the daily errands that make such a significant difference”. He added that officials were “working with supermarkets to make sure that a greater number of delivery slots are made available to those most in need”. On how the government is finding a balance between the other impacts of lockdown compared to the impact of coronavirus infections, Gove said the government’s five tests for lifting the lockdown are an “appropriate” way to measure that balance. Prof Powis said the harm that might be done as a direct effect due to the virus has to be balanced against the harms to health as a result of the lockdown, adding the NHS is “very aware” of this. On PPE, Gove said: “From February 25 to May 2 we had delivered over 1.08 billion items of PPE across the health and social care system within England. “And tens of millions more have been distributed by our colleagues in the devolved administrations. “This overall figure includes 149 million masks, 173 million aprons, two million gowns and 614 million gloves. “On May 2 alone we delivered an additional 20 million items of PPE within England.” He said there is “much more to do”. Gove said the government has committed 100 million for remote learning for “those who need it most” and 180 video lessons per week were being supplied through the newly launched Oak National Academy. “We’re particularly keen to help vulnerable and disadvantaged children to carry on with their education during the pandemic,” he said. Gove added the government has ordered laptops for disadvantaged children sitting exams next year and for children with social workers to help them stay in touch with vital services. He said free internet routers and free school meal vouchers are being provided for those who need them. In response to a question about what lessons the government has learned to prepare the NHS for future waves of coronavirus infections, Gove says the UK has learned how to improve testing capacity, PPE production and the production of ventilators. Prof Powis says, if the R rate of reproduction of the virus is kept below 1, the UK should be protected from future waves of infections. He added the NHS has been found to be “incredibly agile” in terms of increasing capacity when it is needed. Prof Stephen Powis said the peak of hospital admissions has now passed, particularly in London. Gove now hands over to Professor Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England. Prof Powis says Britons are continuing to respond to social distancing measures and have done so “magnificently”. He admits there has been a “dip” in the number of coronavirus tests conducted over the weekend, but says the testing level is expected to increase over the coming days. It’s “evident” the rate of coronavirus transmission in the community is decreasing despite the increase in testing which would show up more cases. He added: “The trend now is downwards” as he displays a graph of the number of deaths in the UK. Prof Powis confirms the UK is through the peak of deaths. Gove says the government wants a greater number of children classified as vulnerable to go to school. Currently only around one in ten are attending. He added that 15,500 schools have asked to turn free school meals into food vouchers, with £35 million worth of vouchers claimed. Gove says the government has pledged an additional £1.6 billion to councils across England to support their “essential frontline services” including adult social care. Gove said “before we can ease the existing restrictions we must ensure the government’s five tests are met - that the number of cases are falling, that death rates are declining, that the NHS has what it needs, and that measures are in place to stop a second peak overwhelming the NHS.” He said he is “particularly conscious” that those in the frontline of our public services will need “clear guidance on safe working”. The minister added: “They’ll need the right personal protective equipment and appropriate access to testing if we are to make all the progress that we want in the weeks ahead. “We’re consulting with employers and unions, professionals and public health experts, to establish how we can ensure that we have the safest possible working environments, and the Prime Minister will be saying more later this week.” Gove said more than 200,000 key workers and their families had been tested for coronavirus. He said criteria for testing had been extended beyond key workers to anyone over 65 displaying symptoms and anyone who has to travel to get to work. Gove also confirmed that this week the government will be piloting new “test, track and trace procedures” on the Isle of Wight with a view to having them in place more widely later this month. Reaction to Gove’s admission on the testing numbers. Gove paid tribute to Muslims celebrating Ramadan during lockdown who are mourning the loss of a loved one. He said: “For those experiencing the first Ramadan without a loved one, this will be a particularly painful time. “As with Christians who could not celebrate Easter together in church, and the Jewish community whose Passover rituals were affected by social distancing, our thoughts are with Muslim neighbours who cannot break their fast together and must adapt their religious and cultural practices because of the crisis.” The Cabinet Minister said: “The prime minister’s comprehensive plan will explain how we can get our economy moving, how we can get our children back to school, how we can travel to work more safely and how we can make life in the workplace safer.” He added that over the Easter holidays, 60% of schools remained open for the children of key workers. Gove reveals 76,496 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning, which is below the 100,000 target it had previously set. Gove says the prime minister will say more this week about how people will be allowed to go back to work when the UK’s lockdown is eased. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove begins the briefing by confirming that 76,496 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. And he announces 28,446 people have now died with coronavirus in the UK, up by 315 from 28,131 the day before. The government’s 4pm briefing has been delayed and is expected to start within the next 20 minutes. The Welsh government does “not see the science” in recent extensions to England’s testing policy, according to Wales’ health minister Vaughan Gething. He also raised doubts about the benefits and validity of England’s 100,000 tests-per-day target and defended his own country’s decision not to extend testing to all care homes regardless of whether there is an outbreak. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Gething said: “England have gone out and created lots of capacity very quickly and they’ve then gone out and used that capacity. “The challenge is though, that from a policy point of view there is clearly a difference, but that’s partly because England decided that having set a big target they needed to go out and use all the tests. “Now, other people will tell you about how many of those tests are actual tests, or tests that have been sent out. “But part of the difficulty we’ve had is that the scientific underpinning for how and why you extend that policy isn’t something where there has been a fully informed debate in advance, and we don’t see that the science supports all of the differences in policy and the testing reach in England.” Asked if Wales could increase its number of tests available, Gething said: “That capacity is being increased each week. “For the current purpose of keeping people safe, in particular key workers, on understanding people in our healthcare system actually have coronavirus, we do have enough capacity. “But the continued build-up of capacity here is being driven at what happens for us to be able to get out of lockdown.” He also criticised the UK Government for including a testing centre in Cardiff on its test-booking website, despite it being under the control of the Welsh Government, and as such tells users that testing is “unavailable” in Wales. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove is scheduled to lead the government’s press conference in around five minutes. Joining him for the Downing Street briefing will be Professor Stephen Powis, the medical director for NHS England. Airline UK, which represents British Airways, Easyjet, Virgin Atlantic, Ryanair and other UK-based airlines, has warned that a 14-day quarantine period “would effectively kill air travel”. Transport secretary Grant Shapps today told the BBC a compulsory 14-day quarantine could be imposed on anyone arriving in the country so when infection rates in the country are under control “we’re not importing”. Tim Alderslade, Airline UK chief executive, said a quarantine would “completely shut off the UK from the rest of the world when other countries are opening up their economies” and described the possible quarantine measure as a “blunt tool”. A paramedic has died in hospital after contracting Covid-19. He has been named locally as Robert Black from Campbeltown in Scotland. He died in a Glasgow hospital on Saturday. Pauline Howie, chief executive of the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS), who did not name Black, said the service had been “greatly saddened” by the loss of a “dear colleague”. On behalf of the SAS, she offered her “heart-felt condolences and deepest sympathies” to his family. Howie added: “I would also like to thank our NHS Scotland colleagues for the compassionate care they have shown our friend during their illness.” Radio station Argyll FM, where Black worked, said on its Facebook page that he was “a much loved member” of the team and would be “sorely missed”. At the Scottish government’s daily briefing, health secretary Jeane Freeman announced that outreach workers supplying emergency Naloxone, the life-saving overdose reversal drug, will not be prosecuted. Whilst it might seem peculiar that anyone attempting to save a life would be at risk of breaking the law, remember that drug laws are reserved to Westminster, there are particular legal restrictions around who can supply this particular drug and this change will allow drug treatment services to offer the life-saving kits without any concerns. Freeman said that the Lord Advocate has agreed that “it would not be in the public interest, for the duration of the current crisis, for any individual working for a service registered with the Scottish government to be prosecuted for supplying naloxone in an emergency to save a life”. She also announced extra funding for two specialist organisations helping people with autism, acknowledging that changes to routine and stress are especially difficult for those who are autistic, as well as more support for young people and families – funding to develop digital resources on mental well-being for teens and funding for a helpline that specialises in help for those experiencing relationship difficulties. Earlier on Sunday, first minister Nicola Sturgeon backed up the Welsh government on Twitter as regards who will make decisions about children returning to school. Both Welsh and Scottish governments have stressed that they would prefer a four nations approach to lifting lockdown, but the differences in tone between devolved administrations and Westminster are becoming ever more apparent. Professor Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, has spoken about the prospect of a vaccine in the next year. He told NBC “the prospects are pretty good, I certainly wouldn’t put the possibility at 80 percent”. Sir Bell said: “People who have dedicated their careers to this kind of a problem have a tendency to get excited about the prospects because the prospects are pretty good. “I certainly wouldn’t put the possibility at 80% -- that’s a pretty big number. But we are gradually reeling it in bit by bit and as every day goes by, the likelihood of success goes up.” He added: “We’ve already started clinical trials, so we’ve already given the vaccine to about a thousand people and we’re going to grow that pretty rapidly. “We’ve consolidated the phase one and two programs because we are pretty confident that the vector itself is safe because it’s been used in about 5,000 people already up to now. “So that’s allowed us to really accelerate the phase one program and we hope that there would be enough disease that we would get evidence that the vaccine has efficacy by the beginning of June.” Of the 21,180 reported coronavirus deaths so far in hospitals in England, 11,090 (52%) have been people aged 80 and over while 8,238 (39%) were 60-79. A further 1,691 (8%) were aged 40-59, with 150 (1%) aged 20-39 and 11 (0.05%) aged 0-19, according to NHS England. The number of deaths announced so far by University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust has reached 778, the highest number for any trust in England. London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust has announced 520 deaths. Three trusts have announced between 400 and 500 deaths: the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust (446), King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (432) and Barts Health NHS Trust (412). A further seven trusts have announced between 300 and 400 deaths. A further 14 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of deaths to 983, Public Health Wales said. Another 174 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 10,329. As of 2pm today, 12,097 people positive for coronavirus in Scotland while 1,571 patients have sadly died, an increase of 12. Some 60,295 people in Scotland have been tested for the virus. There have been a further five confirmed deaths of patients who tested positive for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, according to the Department of Health, bringing the total deaths in the region to 381. NHS England has announced 327 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 21,180. Of the 327 new deaths announced today: - 56 occurred on May 2 - 125 occurred on May 1 - 43 occurred on April 30 The data also show 95 of the new deaths took place between April 1 and April 29 while the remaining eight deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on March 28. The figures published today by NHS England show April 8 remains the day with the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring with a total of 867. A “doomsday” management exercise in which Tesco, the UK’s biggest supermarket chain imagined its head office would have to shut down completely, helped the company to cope with the impact of the pandemic. Sarah Butler has written an interesting piece, based on an interview with Tesco’s chief executive, Dave Lewis. In January, Tesco’s first concerns about the coronavirus were focused on ensuring its non-food ranges were not affected by the impact of the outbreak in China. But by the end of that month the supermarket had spied big potential problems looming, and had a crisis response group in place which was holding daily meetings. Three rail unions have written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, Mark Drakeford, the First Minister of Wales, and Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, saying this is not the time to lift the lockdown and run more trains. The joint letter – signed by the heads of ASLEF, RMT and the TSSA– says it is ‘completely unacceptable’ to put the lives of passengers and rail staff at risk. They warn: We have severe concerns over attempts by operators to increase service levels. First, it sends out a mixed message that it is okay to travel by train – despite official advice suggesting otherwise. This mixed messaging could be dangerous and lead to the public flouting the rules on travel and work. Second, there is no agreement on how actually services can be increased whilst protecting workers and passengers. This includes protections through social distancing, adequate and appropriate PPE, and determination of essential and non-essential tasks. Deborah Buchanan, a woman in Northern Ireland who shared a final photo of her dying mum in hospital in a bid to get people to wake up to the realities of coronavirus, wrote about it on Facebook. “We had to watch her gasp her last breaths and slip away in agony. My dad says this is the worst thing he has ever felt in his life, he fears going to sleep incase he doesn’t wake up. They hadn’t left the house in weeks but still picked this up and both took very unwell,” she wrote. The BBC declined the opportunity today to respond publicly to the letter from culture minister Oliver Dowden, but a spokesperson did that they the broadcaster wanted to highlight comments by the prime minister earlier in the week in relation to personal protective equipment (PPE). Speaking at the No 10 briefing for the first time since recovering from the virus, he said: I’m not going to minimise the logistical problems we’ve faced in getting the right protective gear to the right people in the right place, both in the NHS and care homes. The BBC has stood by its defence of a Panorama investigation exposing shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) among healthcare workers, after a formal complaint from the culture secretary. Oliver Dowden, in a letter to the BBC director general, Tony Hall, claimed the corporation was at risk of losing the public’s confidence amid accusations of political bias. Last week Panorama reported that gowns, visors, swabs and body bags were left out of the government’s stockpile when it was set up in 2009. Some of the items are now in short supply. Since the programme aired, a number of NHS workers who were interviewed for it were reported to be either longstanding members or supporters of the Labour party. Dowden also referred to another recent incident in which the BBC admitted it had made a mistake by reporting that a boss of an NHS trust had contacted the broadcaster with concerns about the provision of gowns for staff during the coronavirus crisis. “I am sure you will agree that it is vital that public confidence is maintained in the BBC’s longstanding reputation for fair and balanced reporting, and that any damage to that would be deeply concerning,” Dowden wrote in the letter, excerpts of which have been published by the Mail on Sunday. A spokesperson for the BBC confirmed on Sunday that it had received Dowden’s letter, adding it would respond in due course. It referred to a statement issued last week that said sources for its PPE revelations were not the doctors who appeared on the show. There’s a moving story in Northern Ireland’s Sunday Life newspaper about a woman who shared a final photo of her dying mum in hospital in a bid to get people to wake up to the realities of coronavirus. Deborah Buchanan, from Antrim, posted the image just hours after mum Joan Wright (75) died from Covid-19 on Thursday. “This is the reality of coronavirus. Wake up and wise up,” said Deborah, from Newtownabbey, as she urged people to stay at home.

A woman has had to bury her daughter and husband within days of each other after both died from coronavirus. Tributes were paid to former police officer and Red Cross director David Whincup, 79, and his daughter Joanne Rennison, 52, who both passed away after contracting the disease. MP David Davis described Whincup, from Cottingham in east Yorkshire, as an “utterly decent man”. “David was the kindest, most thoughtful and utterly decent man I have ever had the privilege to meet. He had a fantastic commitment to selfless public service. We shall all miss him greatly,” he added. Whincup, who lived with his wife, Margaret, their daughter Joanne and granddaughter Alice, said his greatest achievement was his family. He worked as a director for the Red Cross and prior to that he was a Humberside police officer for more than 30 years. His charity work raised thousands of pounds for causes in Hull and East Yorkshire and he supported many other charities as a founder member of Haltemprice Lions club in 1973, serving as president four times and as secretary. This evening’s Downing St briefing at 4pm will be fronted by Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and Stephen Powis, National Medical Director of NHS England. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog again now while Nadeem takes a break. More details on the smartphone app to trace the spread of coronavirus which will be trialled on the Isle of Wight this week before being rolled out more widely later this month. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said around 50% to 60% of people will need to use the software for it to be effective as he described it as the “best possible way to help the NHS”. The NHSX app is part of the government’s test, track and trace strategy and will be central to its efforts in slowing the spread of coronavirus. Contact tracing has been used extensively in South Korea, Hong Kong and Germany, where outbreaks have been contained more quickly. The government intends to use the app and a phone team to carry out the tracing. It will be downloaded on to smartphones and use bluetooth technology to work out when other app users are in close enough proximity to potentially spread the virus. The data is recorded under an anonymous ID, rather than by the person’s name. If someone starts showing symptoms, or tests positive for Covid-19, they are able to share that on the app. The app then sends a notification warning of possible infection to all those phone users to have come in requisite proximity recently. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has posted this video on Twitter to thank Londoners for observing the lockdown rules. On a lighter note, actor Eddie Marsan has tackled the challenge of appearing in a new television series while in lockdown by recruiting his family as film crew and performers. Marsan and his wife Janine juggled home-schooling their four children while capturing his scenes for ITV’s Isolation Stories, a four-part drama about families during the coronavirus pandemic. Covid-19 outbreak restrictions saw Janine step behind the camera for the first time to help capture her husband’s performance while two of their children joined in the acting. On his wife’s directorial debut, Marsan told the BBC Andrew Marr show on Sunday: “She was fantastic, she really took it on. “She was moving the cameras, moving the lights, doing the sounds, cooking the lunches, everything.” Janine explained she was given technical support by director David Blair and others via the video conferencing platform Zoom but does not think she would start a new film career. The daily Downing Street briefing will be at 4pm today and will be led by Michael Gove and Stephen Powis, National Medical Director of NHS England. The press conference for David King’s alternative scientific advisory group is tomorrow at 4pm. A passenger plane has landed in the UK with 10 million pairs of surgical gloves for the NHS. The Airbus A340 9H-EAL, with “Thank You NHS” written on its fuselage, arrived at Bournemouth Airport after picking up the supplies from Kuala Lumpur. The aircraft, owned by Bournemouth-based European Aviation Group, touched down at around 8.15am today with the boxes of gloves then passed to NHS supplier Crest Medical, based in Warrington, which commissioned the delivery. Paul Stoddart, European Aviation’s chairman, told the PA news agency: “Today’s flight was a total success. Twenty million gloves, that’s 10 million pairs of gloves, delivered to Crest Medical and on their way to the NHS. “Well done everyone.” The flight is the second to land at the airport with NHS supplies, after 120,000 surgical gowns were brought from Tianjin, northeastern China, on Tuesday. Several more flights are scheduled to depart from Bournemouth over the next few weeks to bring back PPE. Baroness Ros Altmann, a former minister, believes a ban on older people leaving their homes as the rest of the country surfaces from lockdown would be “age discrimination”. She said using age-based criteria to lift restrictions would send a message that older people’s lives “don’t count in the same way as others”. NHS England’s national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said on Friday that officials are considering whether stricter measures will still apply to the elderly when lockdown is eased. Speaking to Sky’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday, Baroness Altmann said: “I think using an age-based criteria is fundamentally wrong and would potentially cost the lives of many people, and risk social unrest.” The life peer said many elderly people have only accepted lockdown conditions “because everyone else has got to do it,” and “lots of them” have said they would “risk going to prison” rather than continue isolating. She added “nobody would dream” of applying restrictions on the basis of skin colour, despite a higher death rate among BAME people. “It’s not OK to discriminate on grounds of gender, or obesity, or colour of skin, but everybody is saying, let’s think about somehow discriminating on the basis of age.” Comedian Sir Michael Palin agreed in a BBC interview that age restrictions would be “very difficult and very wrong and very unfair”. Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organisation’s technical lead on Covid-19, said that many people remain susceptible to the virus, even where transmission has been suppressed. Asked if a second wave of infection could be likely in countries that have started to ease their lockdowns, she said: “It’s certainly possible. What we’re seeing in a number of countries that have been successful in suppressing transmission is that many more people remain susceptible.” She added: “All countries must remain on alert for the possibility of additional transmission even if they have been successful in suppressing transmission in the first round.” Following comments by Prime Minister Boris Johnson that face masks will be “useful” as part of measures to come out of lockdown, Dr Van Kerkhove said that masks are recommended for those who are feeling unwell. She told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme: “We do recommend the use of masks for people who are feeling unwell, but masks alone will not solve the problem, they cannot solve the problem, and especially if you’re thinking about lockdowns and you’re thinking of lifting lockdowns. “There has to be a number of measures that have to be put in place before lockdowns can be released and it must be done in a slow and staggered approach.” Health secretary Matt Hancock has tweeted a link to advice to different groups who are more susceptible to Covid-19. It comes after he responded to a Sunday Times article about people aged over 70 in lockdown by saying the “clinically vulnerable, who are advised to stay in lockdown for 12 weeks, emphatically DO NOT include all over 70s.” There is a “great deal of logic” in targeting the nation’s youngest children to return to school first when the coronavirus lockdown lifts, the head of Ofsted has said. Amanda Spielman said younger pupils need “routine” and, from parents’ perspectives, are those who need the most “care and oversight”. She also said it is in all children’s best interests that they return to the classroom “as soon as possible”, but there is no single “no-brainer answer” on how to do so. “There’s a great deal of logic in targeting younger children,” she told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. “We know that making normality for children is really important, the younger the children, the more they need that simple structured routine where they understand what’s happening. “It’s hard for them to go to school one day and then not for another two weeks. So I entirely recognise and see the logic of this. “I also think there’s a logic from the point of view of parents. The youngest children are the ones who need the greatest care and oversight. “It’s hardest for parents to work and do all the other things they need to do if they’re also looking after perhaps several young children at the same time and trying to make sure they work through schoolwork remotely. “If you look at the interests of children, it’s very clear that their interests are best served, in the vast majority of cases, by being back at school as soon as possible.” Spielman said it is in the “hands of the health experts” to say what is safe and how education could be organised, and she “wouldn’t want to second guess that for one moment”. More from First Minister Mark Drakeford who has defended the decision not to extend coronavirus testing to all care homes in Wales regardless of whether there is a confirmed case or not. He told The Andrew Marr Programme: “The advice we have from our chief medical officer is that if there is no coronavirus at all, in a care home, then testing all residents and staff would not be the best use of the tests that we have available.” Asked if it had been a mistake for Wales to abandon its 5,000 tests-a-day in April, he added: “No, it wasn’t a mistake. “The feeling I had and the feeling reported to me from people in the front line is that the number itself was a distraction. “Carrying out tests, without a purpose or a point is not a good use of the limited resources that we have.” Grant Shapps said he was “actively looking at” quarantining people travelling to the UK from abroad to keep coronavirus infection rates under control. “I think it is important that as we are seeing the numbers decrease and the R rate we hope decrease... that we do ensure that the sacrifices in a sense - social distancing - that we are asking the British people to make are matched by anybody who comes to this country. “I am actively looking at these issues right now so that when we have infection rates within the country under control we are not importing,” he told The Andrew Marr programme. The number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK stood at 182,260 yesterday. Fewer people would have died from coronavirus in the UK if the country had greater testing capacity sooner, transport secretary Grant Shapps said. Asked whether fewer people would have died if testing capacity had been greater sooner, he told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “Yes. If we had had 100,000 test capacity before this thing started and the knowledge that we now have retrospectively I’m sure many things could be different. “The fact of the matter is this is not a country that had - although we’re very big in pharmaceuticals as a country - we’re not a country that had very large test capacity.” Shapps added the UK may have had a high death rate compared to some other countries because of “density of population”. He said Britain has “denser cities” compared to other countries and the number of deaths are high because the figures are a “product of excellent statisticians counting in a way that other countries don’t”. On the issue of infection rates in care homes, he said: “Infections in care homes are now falling, not rising.” He added that patients and residents of care homes can now be tested. First Minister Mark Drakeford has spoken about plans to reopen schools and workplaces in Wales, with the possibility of schools opening by June. Asked for an indication about when pupils could return, he told the BBC’s Andew Marr Show: “Our advice from the trade unions and from the local education authorities is that you will need three weeks as a minimum from the point that we decide to do that, to when schools can reopen, so we are talking about the beginning of June.” Drakeford said some groups could return earlier than others, citing the examples of year-six children who are due to move up to secondary school and Welsh medium pupils who may not have had opportunities to use the language at home during lockdown. He added: “You certainly can’t have schools reopen as they did before and sustain social distancing, and you need it for public health reasons, but you also need it in order to persuade parents and teachers that you are asking young people to come back into an environment that is safe for them.” On testing in care homes, he said Wales is testing all care home staff and care home residents in care homes where there is a case of coronavirus. A former government chief scientific adviser has assembled a group of experts to look at how the UK could work its way out of coronavirus lockdown. Sir David King, who worked under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, created the board “in response to concerns over the lack of transparency coming from the UK Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The new 12-strong committee of academics is keen to investigate seven key points, including how can successful test and trace be achieved, and what social distancing measures will be needed in the future. The new committee’s first press conference will be held on Monday at 4pm, the same usual time as the Downing Street briefings over the weekend. Sir David said transparency within scientific discussion was essential. He told the Sunday Times: “I am not at all critical of the scientists who are putting advice before the government ... but because there is no transparency the government can say they are following scientific advice but we don’t know that they are.” The future of Britain’s world-renowned science sector – and its ability to lead global research into Covid-19 – risks being fatally undermined if the UK crashes out of the EU without a trade deal by the end of this year, Toby Helm and Robin McKie report in the Observer. The warning has been issued by leading scientists – including UK-based Nobel prize winners – as fears grow that British science could lose access to the EU’s €100bn (£85bn) research funding scheme, Horizon Europe, which will run from 2021 to 2027. The government says it is “considering” applying to be an “associate member” (a relationship available for non-member states at the discretion of the 27 member nations) of Horizon Europe and the European Research Council (ERC), which is a component of the funding scheme. The ERC says one of its UK-based “grantees”, Prof Cecilia Mascolo, is already working in this country on rolling out a mobile app to quickly diagnose Covid-19. The government has formally complained to the BBC over a recent Panorama programme reporting on problems with the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline NHS staff. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, wrote to the corporation’s director-general, Tony Hall, warning the corporation it risks losing the public’s confidence as a result of accusation of bias. Key items of personal protective equipment (PPE) were not included in the government’s pandemic stockpile when coronavirus reached the UK, the investigation by BBC Panorama reported It found that gowns, visors, swabs and body bags were left out of the stockpile when it was set up in 2009. Some of the items are now in short supply. However, there was controversy around some of the interviewees, who critics of the BBC and some news outlets described as “left-wing activists.” In a letter, excerpts from which were published in the Mail on Sunday, Dowden says that he was sure Lord Hall “will agree that at a time of heightened risk of misinformation and disinformation, it is more important than ever that the BBC upholds the values and standards we all expect.” ‘The public should be able to turn to the BBC for transparent, unimpeachable, reliable news’. Among those criticising Dowden’s actions today were Alan Rusbridger, formerly of this parish: The prime minister has been tweeting details of “five key tests” that must be satisfied before the government can adjust the current lockdown measures. The last one is: “We must make sure that any adjustments to the current measures do not risk a second spike that would overwhelm the NHS.” Labour’s shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds meanwhile kept up pressure on testing, telling Sky News: “of course I’m pleased that testing has been ramped up. But that in itself is not a strategy.” “Firstly, the testing has to be increased further, I mean the original target we were talking about a quarter of a million tests a day some time ago, but it has to be linked to tracing as well and it’s that testing and tracing that is going to be so important now in terms of easing the measures of the lockdown in the weeks and months ahead.” Many older people would rebel and risk going to prison if they were forced to remain locked down for a considerable period of time as younger people were treated differently, according to Baroness Ros Altmann. The pensions expert and political campaigner on age-related issues, told Sky News: “If they are fit and healthy and need to get out for their own physical health then the idea that the government will tell them you are under house arrest while everybody else is out, and force them into solitary confinement… then I think they wouldn’t accept it.” Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show, the broadcaster Michael Palin also said it would be “very unfair” to treat large numbers of older people differently from others and policy makers had to be “very careful.” For more on fears among older people about an extended lockdown, here is a recent Guardian piece by my colleague Mattha Busby. It’s too early to say how many people in Britain have had Covid-19, according to Ian Diamond, head of the Government Statistical Service, which is receiving initial results from some major surveys over the past number of weeks. Very large numbers of people, more than 80pc, are concerned still and worried about the future not being able to make plans, he said. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show that the survey backed up suggestions that adherence to the lockdown was very good. The number of households with children going hungry has doubled since lockdown began, as millions of people struggle to afford food. New data from the Food Foundation shared exclusively with the Observer has revealed that almost a fifth of households with children have been unable to access enough food in the past five weeks, with meals being skipped and children not getting enough to eat as already vulnerable families battle isolation and a loss of income. The strain on larger families, single parent homes and those with disabled children has been immense. A reported 30% of lone parents and 46% of parents with a disabled child are facing food insecurity and finding it difficult to manage basic nutritional needs at home. With schools no longer providing a reprieve for children reliant on free breakfast clubs and school lunches, poorer families are at crisis point. Using characteristic language, Boris Johnson has described a strategy that evolved for a period of time around plans to announce his potential death from Covid-19 as a “death of Stalin-type scenario.” It’s not entirely clear if he was taking his cue from Armando Iannucci’s (excellent) 2017 satire. Nevertheless, speaking about his hospitalisation recently, he told the Sun on Sunday: “I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place. “The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong. “They gave me a face mask so I got litres and litres of oxygen and for a long time I had that and the little nose jobbie.” Johnson, 55, said it was “hard to believe” his health had deteriorated in just a few days, saying he “couldn’t understand why I wasn’t getting better”. “They had a strategy to deal with a ‘death of Stalin’-type scenario,” he recounted. He told the newspaper that the “indicators kept going in the wrong direction” and that he kept asking himself: “How am I going to get out of this?” “The bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. “That was when it got a bit ... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally.” Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds, have meanwhile named their son Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson, in a tribute to their grandfathers and the doctors who treated the prime minister for coronavirus. Symonds, 32, posted a picture of her holding the newborn on Instagram on Saturday, saying she “couldn’t be happier” and that her “heart is full”. A few developments in relation to misinformation include a call by a leading news organisation for a digital “kitemarking” system online to distinguish between quality journalism and fake content – with internet companies facing penalties if they publish inaccurate information. ITN, the maker of news for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, says the coronavirus pandemic has revealed both the importance of “trustworthy and reliable information” and the dangers to democracy of fast-spreading misinformation. Meanwhile, YouTube has deleted conspiracy theorist David Icke’s account. The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus. The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network. Britain could be asking all visitors to the UK to have the NHS tracking app which is likely to be a major part of the government’s strategy. The system is going into testing on the Isle of Wight later this week and will be rolled out to the population at large provided the tests were responsible, added Grant Shapps. The Transport Secretary said the government needed 60 to 70 percent of people to use the app for it to be successful. He compares it to the clapping which people do on Thursday night. It’s another way to support the NHS, according to Shapps. There’s more on the App here: Active transport and getting people to work “on their own steam” will be a major part of attempts to prevent overcrowding on the public transport network, added Grant Shapps. The Transport Secretary said he would be saying more, “shortly,” in relation to measures such as the scheme which helped people to buy their own bike at a cheaper price. Preventing overcrowding on the transport network will involve a massive logistical operation and will require the same sort of determination as the public have shown in recent weeks. Grant Shapps was non-committal on the question of whether there could be temperature checks on public transport. People should not be leaving home if they feel unwell, adding: “In a sense you should not be there in the first place.” This, of course, leaves doubts about the role of people who are asymptomatic. Pressed, he added: “Yes, it’s possible.” It’s not going to be ‘business as usual’ for the UK when the prime minister details plans for changing or lifting lockdown measures later this week, according to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, but people do want to see a “road map”. Shapps told Sophy Ridge on Sky News that testing, tracking and tracing would be “vital” in terms of next steps. He added that it was no secret that the government wants children to go back to school but he was reluctant to give a date. The Sunday Telegraph has a front page story today on a government ‘blue print’ for schools to return in June. A failure to provide care homes with enough NHS expertise and hospital equipment has exacerbated the growing coronavirus crisis among their residents, senior care figures have warned. Thousands of deaths within homes have come alongside spare intensive care capacity in hospitals, raising concerns in the social care sector that resources have been misallocated. It has also prompted scepticism within the sector over claims from Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, that the threat to care homes had been “flagged” since the start of the pandemic. Care home owners are now warning that the sector is still some way off a peak in cases, unlike the country as a whole. Official data next week is expected to show well over 5,000 care home deaths in total.\\ However, unions are also warning that money has been stripped out of the care home sector for years in profits, leaving it underfunded and ill-prepared. Among other things, we’ll be keeping an eye on the Sunday morning news shows. Transport Minister Grant Shapps and Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds are on Sophy Ridge on Sky from 830am. Following that World Health Organisation (WHO) Covid-19 technical lead Dr Maria Van Kerkhove and Wales’ First Minister Mark Drakeford are on the Andrew Marr show on BBC One from 9am. Later today, a Scottish Government briefing expected is expected at 2.30pm, while a Downing Street briefing is scheduled for 4pm. Good morning. It’s Ben Quinn here at the helm of the live blog to steer you through the start of the day’s coronavirus developments in the UK. They include a revelation by the prime minister that doctors prepared to announce his death as he battled coronavirus in hospital last month. Boris Johnson spent three nights in intensive care at St Thomas’ in London with the disease, where he said medics gave him “litres and litres of oxygen”. In an interview with the Sun on Sunday, he described it as a “tough old moment”, adding: “They had a strategy to deal with a ‘death of Stalin’-type scenario. “I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place. Some suggest the experience has had a dramatic impact on what his views, otherwise, may have been when it comes to lifting Britain’s lockdown. That’s not going to be an easy task, if new indications of public mood today are anything to go by. Fewer than one in five of the British public believe the time is right to consider reopening schools, restaurants, pubs and stadiums. The findings, in a new poll for the Observer, suggest Boris Johnson will struggle to convince people to return their lives to normal if he tries to ease the lockdown soon. The poll by Opinium, taken between Wednesday and Friday last week, found 17% of people think the conditions have been met to consider reopening schools, against 67% who say they have not been, and that they should stay closed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2020/may/03/justin-amash-republicans-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-03T16:50:05Z","webTitle":"Justin Amash laments 'partisan death spiral' but insists White House run won't help Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/justin-amash-republicans-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2020/may/03/justin-amash-republicans-trump","fields":{"headline":"Justin Amash laments 'partisan death spiral' but insists White House run won't help Trump","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/dnehz","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/92ca7cc7701e97c1d29cd4df7b497400eb8d3333/0_183_3500_2101/500.jpg","bodyText":"Justin Amash left the Republican party because it was in a “partisan death spiral” but insists his White House run as a Libertarian won’t help Donald Trump maintain the GOP’s grip on the White House. “Washington is totally dysfunctional,” Amash told CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday. “That’s why I left the Republican party, because there was this partisan death spiral. “We need someone who’s going to come in as president, respect our constitution, defend our rights, and fix our representative system of government so that people will actually feel represented at home. And I know that millions of Americans want that.” The former member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus left the Republicans in 2019. He then voted to impeach Trump and remove him from office, as the GOP stayed ranged behind the president. Amash announced his third-party run this week, to criticism that he risked taking voters from Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic challenger who leads the president in many national and key-state polls. “We don’t know how the additional candidate changes a race,” Amash insisted on Sunday. “It’s too impossible to figure out. There are too many calculations involved. So, the most important thing is that we have a ballot. If you want to vote for someone, you vote for that person.” Many observers suggest third-party candidates can change presidential elections. In 1992, for example, Ross Perot ran as an independent and won 19% of the vote as a Democratic challenger, Bill Clinton, beat incumbent Republican George HW Bush. Green candidate Ralph Nader’s run eight years later is perhaps the most famous third-party campaign, given that George W Bush beat Al Gore in a desperately tight race. Nader told the Guardian this week “there are all kinds of other reasons that the Democrats lost” in 2000, not least that Bush “was selected by five out of nine supreme court justices in a judicial coup d’etat”. But the political strategist Bob Shrum countered that Nader “hurt because he attacked Gore from the left: that was his argument.” Shrum added: “I don’t know that Amash is in the same position. The assumption that he would take votes from Biden rather than Trump seems dubious to me at best.” Amash is a stringent conservative, unlikely to appeal to many supporters of a centrist Democrat pushed left on policy by the challenge of Bernie Sanders and committed to naming a woman, quite possibly an African American, as his proposed vice-president. In 2016, the Libertarian Gary Johnson took nearly 4.5m votes nationally. Trump however lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3m ballots. The White House was won, as it always is, in the electoral college. In that fight Amash’s home state, Michigan, was a key win for Trump over Clinton by just 10,704 votes, less than 0.25%, while Johnson won the support of 172,136 Michiganders – or 3.6% of turnout. The Green candidate, Jill Stein, won 51,463 votes, or 1.1%. Rejecting criticism from the former congressman Joe Walsh, who ran against Trump in the Republican primary and told the Guardian his friend was making “a huge mistake”, Amash insisted “there’s an opening for a Libertarian party to become a major party in this country”. “I think we’re at a crossroads. There is a difference over the last decade or so, where people are more polarized, more upset, but, actually, most Americans are delightful people, are polite people, want to work with each other, respect each other. “And these two factions that really control our political system are destroying our system and making it impossible for the rest of us to, frankly, enjoy our lives.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2020/may/03/elderly-must-not-be-left-out-of-lockdown-easing-says-michael-palin","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-03T16:47:58Z","webTitle":"Elderly must not be left out of lockdown easing, says Michael Palin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/03/elderly-must-not-be-left-out-of-lockdown-easing-says-michael-palin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2020/may/03/elderly-must-not-be-left-out-of-lockdown-easing-says-michael-palin","fields":{"headline":"Elderly must not be left out of lockdown easing, says Michael Palin","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/dneg9","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/dffa93d879add010c1408514cb1d86e69c279aec/0_478_3575_2145/500.jpg","bodyText":"The actor Sir Michael Palin and the peer and former ageism tsar Ros Altmann have joined calls for the government not to exclude healthy pensioners if lockdown restrictions are relaxed. Leading medical professionals have said that excluding any section of the population from lockdown easing based solely on age would be discriminatory. On Friday, NHS England’s national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said officials would be studying whether stricter measures will continue to apply to elderly people when restrictions are relaxed. But Altmann, a former pensions minister, said using age-based criteria to lift restrictions would send a message that older people’s lives “don’t count in the same way as others”. Palin agreed that age restrictions would be “very difficult and very wrong and very unfair”. Speaking to Sky’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday, Altmann said: “I think using an age-based criteria is fundamentally wrong and would potentially cost the lives of many people, and risk social unrest.” The baroness said many elderly people have only accepted lockdown conditions “because everyone else has got to do it”, and many have said they would “risk going to prison” rather than continue isolating. She added “nobody would dream” of applying restrictions on the basis of skin colour, despite a higher death rate among black, Asian and minority ethnic people. Altmann’s concerns were shared by Palin, who told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that it would be “very wrong” to exclude over-70s from lockdown easing. “I think it’s a difficult call every time, but you’ve got to be more selective here, because there are a great deal, a great number, of people in their 70s who are very active, very thoughtful, who’ve got lots of ideas, can contribute to our recovery. “And I think that to treat them all as people who have to be sort of kept out of sight is going to be very difficult and very wrong, and very unfair on a lot of people who want to help,” he said. The British Medical Association’s chair, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said any proposal to impose stricter social distancing for those at higher risk – essentially quarantining – based solely on age would be “both unethical and illegal”. He added: “While any strategy to ease the lockdown must ensure the UK does not see a second wave of Covid-19 infection, it must also balance this with the rights and needs of individuals across the UK.” Age UK’s charity director, Caroline Abrahams, also spoke out against “blanket policies based on age”. Meanwhile, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, tweeted: “We have strongly advised all over 70s to follow social distancing measures. However, there is no ‘blanket ban’, and the suggestion that the clinically vulnerable “include ‘people aged 70 or older regardless of medical conditions’” is wrong and deeply misleading.” That prompted some on social media to point to advice published on the government website on Friday, which includes the words: “Clinically vulnerable people are those who are: aged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions) ...” When contacted, the Department of Health and Social Care said the over-70s “are not included in the most at-risk group (extremely clinically vulnerable), who have been told to isolate for 12 weeks”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
