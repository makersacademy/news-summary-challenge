var summary = [{
  "text": "Members of Ukip voted yesterday to sack Henry Bolton, who had been elected only last September as the crisis-hit party’s fourth leader in 18 months. Bolton had been clinging on to the leadership despite a revolt by senior figures after the press reported his relationship with Jo Marney, a model who sent offensive messages about Meghan Markle, the fiancee of Prince Harry.\n\nBolton was ousted on Saturday at an emergency meeting where an overwhelming majority of party members endorsed a motion of no confidence in his leadership passed by the party’s ruling national executive committee (NEC). Activists at the meeting in Birmingham voted by 867 to 500 in favour of a no-confidence motion on his ability to lead Ukip.\n\nThe party’s new interim leader is Gerard Batten, a Ukip MEP who sparked controversy last year when he said that non-Muslims should have a “perfectly rational fear” of Islam, which he described as a “death cult” steeped in violence. To cheers, he told members on Saturday that getting rid of Bolton was the best result that could have been achieved.\n\n“We have had many many crises in Ukip and I think this one today was about whether we have a future or not,” Batten told the meeting.\n\nSpeaking after the vote, Bolton said that he did not know whether he would stand again as leader, and hinted at “other options” which could include joining or setting up another party. “I am slightly disappointed. You don’t embark upon something like this with the intention of losing,” he told Sky News.\n\n“It’s not a great feeling but you can’t keep a good man down and I have not finished with politics. It’s just one of those bumps in the road. I’ve just spoken to my team, we’ve had a quick batting around of the different options and we’ll continue doing that over the next few days.”\n\nBolton also said he was considering legal action to challenge the way the process to oust him was handled. The election of a fifth party leader since Nigel Farage’s resignation in September 2016 will take place within 90 days.\n\nBefore the vote, Bolton had disclosed that he still had “strong affections” for his former girlfriend and he compared the scrutiny of his private life with that faced by Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nWhen the result was announced Marney posted on Twitter: “Pffft. Bunch of muppets. My love for Henry is unconditional of political leaderships. I ain’t going anywhere.”\n\nUkip’s general secretary, Paul Oakley, had suggested that Bolton’s days as leader were numbered even if he survived the vote.",

  "text": "The British embassy in Washington backtracked on promises to host a session of the parliamentary inquiry into fake news, because of worries it might offend Donald Trump, the Observer has learned.\n\nBarely a week before MPs from the digital, culture, media and sport committee were due to arrive in Washington for the historic session on 8 February, they were informed in a letter from foreign office minister Alan Duncan that they would have to find a new venue. “We had a report back ... that either the embassy or the UK government felt this would be unhelpful because of the relationship with the US government,” said Ian Lucas, one of the committee members.\n\nThe government has sought to bolster ties with Trump since his election, with a view to securing a swift post-Brexit trade deal with the US. But the relationship has deteriorated in recent months, after Trump attacked London mayor Sadiq Khan, retweeted videos posted by the far-right Britain First group, then responded angrily when May criticised him.\n\nDiplomats apparently feared that the committee hearings, which have also touched on possible Russian election meddling, could anger the notoriously thin-skinned president.\n\n“The embassy had been booked for the evidence sessions by staff there, but as the visit got closer it became clear that the ambassador was quite sensitive, because of the president, to the whole issue of ‘fake news’,” said another committee member who asked not to be named.\n\n“There was no intention in the evidence of focusing on Donald Trump, but I personally do understand the ambassador’s sensitivity because he’s got a job to do and there has been quite a bit of friction between Trump and Theresa May,” the committee member said. George Washington University was a better venue, and “not hard to find”, he added.\n\nThe Foreign Office confirmed that it wanted to keep a distance between its diplomats and the parliamentary inquiry. “Given the independence of the committee and its inquiry from the government, it would not have been appropriate to hold public evidence sessions in the residence,” a spokesman said. However, he denied that the embassy had made a last-minute reversal, saying use had never been “agreed”.\n\nCommittee chair Damian Collins said there were logistical problems but referred questions about the last-minute decision to the Foreign Office. “The embassy wasn’t able to accommodate our requirements, so we looked for an alternative venue,” he said. “We needed a lot of space.”\n\nThe ambassador’s residence in Washington is a spacious historic building, and the embassy itself includes the vast Rotunda room, often used to host large public events, including concerts.\n\nIt was to be the first live broadcast and public hearing of a House of Commons select committee outside the UK, with the MPs questioning members of the technology industry on their role in promoting fake news and misinformation online.\n\nThe embassy’s last-minute decision to prioritise concerns about Trump’s reaction over a historic parliamentary session was slammed by the Labour MP, Ian Murray.\n\n“The fact that our own elected MPs weren’t able to hold a committee meeting at the UK embassy in Washington DC because of fears it would upset the president is, frankly, embarrassing,” said Murray, a supporter of the Open Britain campaign group. “People didn’t vote for Brexit just so we could cosy up to Donald Trump.”\n\nLucas also said he was unhappy about the last-minute change butwanted to make sure the event took place so that, rather than the focus being on the decision about the venue, it was on getting on with the hearings.\n\nThe US-UK relationship under Trump appeared to have got off to a strong start, with May the first foreign leader to visit the White House after his inauguration. But the two leaders do not appear to have a natural rapport, and Trump has shown little interest in ties with London.\n\nMay’s first trip was defined by a photos of a bizarre moment when the two walked hand-in-hand, and that turned out to be the highpoint in a relationship that has spiralled downward ever since. She had tried to woo Trump with the offer of a state visit, hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace, unusually early in his term of office. But no date was set after it became clear that mass protests would greet any trip, and Trump also cancelled another visit this year, for the opening of the US embassy.",

  "text": "Jeremy Corbyn has come under intense pressure to shift Labour’s position on Brexit after 20,000 members demanded a say over the issue and former leader Neil Kinnock backed halting Britain’s EU exit altogether.\n\nIt is understood that the Labour leader will also be confronted by some in his shadow cabinet this week who want him to back remaining in the single market and customs union.\n\nSpeaking to the Observer, Kinnock said he had been angered by claims from Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, that the NHS should benefit from the money saved by leaving the European Union. He said the reality was that “we should stop Brexit to save the NHS” or at the very least “mitigate the damage” by staying within the single market.\n\n“Even contempt for ‘experts’ cannot obscure the evidence that the Johnson-led Brexit vote has already damaged and will inflict future harm on the NHS,” Kinnock said. “Meanwhile – vitally - Brexit has already diminished, and will continue to depress, the revenues on which the NHS depends.\n\n“If Johnson really wanted the extra NHS spending, which is sorely needed, he wouldn’t be using the issue as a ploy to feed his lust for the Tory leadership but would be working to end Brexit.\n\n“The truth is that we can either take the increasingly plain risks and costs of leaving the EU or have the stability, growth and revenues vital for crucial public services like the NHS and social care. Recognising that, we should stop Brexit to save the NHS – or, at very least, mitigate the damage by seeking European Economic Area membership.”\n\nLabour is currently backing a “jobs first” Brexit, but what this would mean in practice has remained vague. The party was sharply criticised when it emerged that none of the eight policy commissions it has set up since the elections focuses on Brexit. Almost 20,000 people emailed the party last week urging it to use the exercise to consult members on the issue.\n\nThe pressure on Labour’s leadership comes as a second major donor pledged a six-figure sum to fund a campaign to stop Brexit and warned that he would “not be silenced” by attacks he believes are designed to discourage those opposed to Britain’s exit from the EU. Stephen Peel, an Olympic rower and former Tory donor, said he had not been put off by attacks aimed at George Soros, the billionaire financier who faced a backlash from Brexiters after giving £400,000 to a new anti-Brexit campaign.\n\nHe told the Observer he was giving £100,000 to Best for Britain, which is organising a grassroots anti-Brexit campaign, as it was “the most important political issue of a generation and one about which I deeply care”.\n\nHe added: “We have heard the strident calls from those against us to try and close down debate and silence discussion over the disaster that Brexit appears to be. I for one, will not be silenced and will do all I can to support groups such as Best for Britain who seek to engage people across the country and make the case for Britain to lead, not leave Europe.\n\n“The key task is to empower the people of Britain, provide clear information on Brexit, and encourage them to make their views known to their representatives in parliament. How can this be anything but democratic?”\n\nHe said that his donation was designed to match smaller donations raised through crowdfunding. “It will help Best for Britain to campaign, inform and engage a broad electorate across Britain and seek to end the slow motion car crash that we are seeing right before our eyes,” he said.\n\nNews of the donation came as a key Labour policy meeting descended into chaos and acrimony yesterday, after an extraordinary row over an internal party post led to claims of bullying and gerrymandering.\n\nThe party had been due to elect a new chair for its National Policy Forum (NPF) at an event in Leeds but the vote was put off at the last minute, with some claiming it had been shelved because a candidate not favoured by leading Corbyn supporters was set to win. The party said the vote had simply been put off to ensure it complied with its rules. In a sign of the simmering tensions still inside the party, the stand-off led to angry exchanges, while a senior official was ushered away from the event’s podium after attempting to put the issue to a vote. It led to the meeting being adjourned and a speech by the Labour leader being delayed.",

  "text": "At this stage of the Brexit talks there seem to be few barriers to the Tory party dominating the outcome. It’s not the string of opinion polls showing Theresa May either ahead, neck and neck or only marginally behind Labour, all of which are stunningly positive survey results for a government in such disarray.\n\nNor is it the way Boris Johnson and Anna Soubry slug it out with passion and alternative visions of Brexit, while Labour MPs merely lament the referendum result, stymied by a leadership that has so far preferred to play tactical games rather than put forward its preferred post-Brexit relationships.\n\nIt is that the Tory party, which last year secured the largest share of the vote in a general election since 1983, has retained its ability to attract older voters. Anxious about their wealth and standard of living above all else, this is the group that voted for May in vast numbers, despite her lacklustre performance and a manifesto that appeared to question some of their privileges.\n\nAlmost as bad for Labour as the demand from older voters to protect their wealth and savings with low taxes and minimal public spending, is the sense that this group has come to distrust the very public institutions that Labour believes should provide the bedrock of its Brit-makeover.\n\nSadly, many over-50s have lost faith in the public sector’s ability to provide services effectively or build the next generation of infrastructure. This lack of trust goes hand in hand with, and is almost as damaging as, their support for austerity.\n\nGo along to any public consultation and the over-50s are there in force, swamping the numbers of younger people. Their aim is to protect and conserve, which means fighting proposals for new housing projects, solar farms and cycle lanes.\n\nYou might be reading this article and be over the age of 50 and think that all the people you know want to embrace change, believe public spending is a force for good and that the collapse of government outsourcing firm Carillion and the east coast rail franchise debacle are unquestionable reasons to support public sector ownership.\n\nSome polls give succour to those who want the state to run things again. Pushing in the opposite direction is YouGov’s analysis of the last election. It shows that the Tories won a significant majority of votes over Labour and did it with the solid support of those who have two score and 10 years under their belt.\n\nBacking for the Tories was even more pronounced among the over-70s. They voted by seven to three in favour of the Tories over Labour on a turnout of 84%, compared to 61% of those aged 30 to 39.\n\nMaking matters worse, while YouGov’s post-election survey of 52,000 people found that 49% of voters with a degree or higher qualification voted Labour compared with 32% of those without, those who are actively engaged in the debate via a newspaper tended to vote Tory.\n\nThis high level of engagement among Tory-voting older people should make Labour leaders pause, as they seek to promote a version of the future where public institutions have grabbed back the decision-making and delivery of services and the infrastructure-building handed to the private sector in the last 30 years. Labour has an economic programme that just doesn’t fly with a British voting public that has never embraced socialism and doesn’t look like starting now.\n\nA good example is the proposal by shadow housing minister John Healey for the public sector to buy land for homes, cutting out the property development industry from major housing schemes. It is a version of the Dutch way of building new affordable homes that involves buying sites close to their value without planning consent.\n\nThe homes are built by private companies, but to specifications set by the public body. It stops the haggling over land prices that inevitably means the developer overpaying for the land and then blackmailing the local authority into accepting more luxury homes than is warranted.\n\nWisely, Healey has in mind a new body called the English Sovereign Land Trust to fund the scheme and support the embattled local planning authority.

  "text": "The British embassy in Washington backtracked on promises to host a session of the parliamentary inquiry into fake news, because of worries it might offend Donald Trump, the Observer has learned.\n\nBarely a week before MPs from the digital, culture, media and sport committee were due to arrive in Washington for the historic session on 8 February, they were informed in a letter from foreign office minister Alan Duncan that they would have to find a new venue. “We had a report back ... that either the embassy or the UK government felt this would be unhelpful because of the relationship with the US government,” said Ian Lucas, one of the committee members.\n\nThe government has sought to bolster ties with Trump since his election, with a view to securing a swift post-Brexit trade deal with the US. But the relationship has deteriorated in recent months, after Trump attacked London mayor Sadiq Khan, retweeted videos posted by the far-right Britain First group, then responded angrily when May criticised him.\n\nDiplomats apparently feared that the committee hearings, which have also touched on possible Russian election meddling, could anger the notoriously thin-skinned president.\n\n“The embassy had been booked for the evidence sessions by staff there, but as the visit got closer it became clear that the ambassador was quite sensitive, because of the president, to the whole issue of ‘fake news’,” said another committee member who asked not to be named.\n\n“There was no intention in the evidence of focusing on Donald Trump, but I personally do understand the ambassador’s sensitivity because he’s got a job to do and there has been quite a bit of friction between Trump and Theresa May,” the committee member said. George Washington University was a better venue, and “not hard to find”, he added.\n\nThe Foreign Office confirmed that it wanted to keep a distance between its diplomats and the parliamentary inquiry. “Given the independence of the committee and its inquiry from the government, it would not have been appropriate to hold public evidence sessions in the residence,” a spokesman said. However, he denied that the embassy had made a last-minute reversal, saying use had never been “agreed”.\n\nCommittee chair Damian Collins said there were logistical problems but referred questions about the last-minute decision to the Foreign Office. “The embassy wasn’t able to accommodate our requirements, so we looked for an alternative venue,” he said. “We needed a lot of space.”\n\nThe ambassador’s residence in Washington is a spacious historic building, and the embassy itself includes the vast Rotunda room, often used to host large public events, including concerts.\n\nIt was to be the first live broadcast and public hearing of a House of Commons select committee outside the UK, with the MPs questioning members of the technology industry on their role in promoting fake news and misinformation online.\n\nThe embassy’s last-minute decision to prioritise concerns about Trump’s reaction over a historic parliamentary session was slammed by the Labour MP, Ian Murray.\n\n“The fact that our own elected MPs weren’t able to hold a committee meeting at the UK embassy in Washington DC because of fears it would upset the president is, frankly, embarrassing,” said Murray, a supporter of the Open Britain campaign group. “People didn’t vote for Brexit just so we could cosy up to Donald Trump.”\n\nLucas also said he was unhappy about the last-minute change butwanted to make sure the event took place so that, rather than the focus being on the decision about the venue, it was on getting on with the hearings.\n\nThe US-UK relationship under Trump appeared to have got off to a strong start, with May the first foreign leader to visit the White House after his inauguration. But the two leaders do not appear to have a natural rapport, and Trump has shown little interest in ties with London.\n\nMay’s first trip was defined by a photos of a bizarre moment when the two walked hand-in-hand, and that turned out to be the highpoint in a relationship that has spiralled downward ever since. She had tried to woo Trump with the offer of a state visit, hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace, unusually early in his term of office. But no date was set after it became clear that mass protests would greet any trip, and Trump also cancelled another visit this year, for the opening of the US embassy.",
