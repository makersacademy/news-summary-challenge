  "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are seeking to register the “Sussex Royal” brand as a global trademark for a range of items and activities including clothing, stationery and the running of “emotional support groups”, international filings suggest.\n\nThe application covering Australia, Canada, the EU and US was filed in December with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in the name of their new foundation, according to details online.\n\nAs well as the application to register Sussex Royal – which the couple have been using on their Instagram account and on a website launched last week as they announced they were “stepping back” as senior royals – one was also made to register “Sussex Royal the Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex”.\n\nSix classes were listed in the applications, covering printed matter such as magazines and greeting cards, clothing ranging from footwear to pyjamas, charitable fundraising and management, as well as education and social care services including the organising and conducting of “emotional support groups”.\n\nApplications to trademark Sussex Royal for a range of goods and activities were lodged with UK intellectual property authorities last June by their advisers Natalie Campbell and Sara Latham. Ownership was switched to the couple in December.\n\nHowever, Harry and Meghan face having to potentially make an objection to protect their would-be brand after an application was lodged with EU authorities to trademark a range of goods including beer and jewellery under Sussex Royal.\n\nIt was lodged on Thursday by an applicant who appears to be based in Italy and filed it in German, with English listed as a second language. Database searches suggest it was made in the name of Ui Phoenix Kerbl, possibly after the Guardian reported on Thursday that the Sussexes had yet to register their brand outside the UK.\n\nSix categories of goods and services were listed – covering areas including toiletries, sporting goods, toys and alcoholic beverages – in the application to the European Union intellectual property office (EUIPO).\n\nSome experts have suggested Harry and Meghan could make as much as £500,000 in their first year of being released from the boundaries of senior royalty, particularly by tapping into the lucrative north American market.\n\nIn a lengthy statement released last week, the couple spoke about a “transition into a new working model” which they believe will enable them to remain members of the royal family but have financial independence.\n\nOthers have speculated that future enterprises could include book deals or a charity-based clothing line, perhaps with an emphasis on sustainability or environmental causes that the couple have taken to heart. Another suggestion is that future ventures combining commercial opportunities with their charitable projects could include Prince Harry’s Apple TV+ project with Oprah, spotlighting mental health.",

  "text": "Riot police have been deployed in parts of Tehran after tear gas was used to clear the streets of protesters angry at the government’s admission it had mistakenly shot down a passenger jet killing all 176 people on board.\n\nImages of dozens of demonstrators taking to the streets in the capital and other cities including Isfahan were circulating on social media as activists called for mass mourning rallies, raising the possibility of fresh clashes between protesters and security forces.\n\nPro-regime protesters also gathered outside the UK embassy calling for its closure after the British ambassador to Iran was briefly detained on Saturday evening after leaving the site of a demonstration.\n\nSeveral Iranian media outlets on Sunday joined a chorus of domestic and international criticism at both the shooting down of the airliner on Wednesday morning and the subsequent days of official denials that an Iranian missile was responsible.\n\nFootage from the Iranian capital showed police in riot gear and on motorcycles massed in public squares and lining the entrances to the University of Tehran, one of the sites where hundreds turned out for protests on Saturday night chanting for prosecutions and a referendum on the country’s theocratic system.\n\nA clip purportedly shot on Sunday morning at Allameh Tabataba’i University in Tehran showed a small group of students chanting slogans against the country’s state-run media outlets. Its authenticity could not be immediately verified.\n\n“They are lying that our enemy is America, our enemy is right here,” said protesters outside a university in Tehran in another clip cited by Reuters. Mourning events were held at several universities across the city.\n\nStudent protests are not unusual in Iran but these latest come at a period of extraordinary tumult for the Islamic Republic, with an economy suffocated by US sanctions, the largest protests in the regime’s history put down by violent force in November, and the revelation that the country’s armed forces shot down a jet loaded with Iranian citizens – then lied about it.\n\nThe rage at the incident appears to have wiped away the nationalist wave the regime was attempting to ride after the killing of General Qassem Suleimani by a US drone strike nine days ago, and the catharsis it sought to deliver with a heavily publicised ballistic missile attack on US forces stationed in Iraq.\n\nIran’s foreign ministry on Sunday summoned the UK ambassador to Tehran, Rob Macaire, to explain what he was doing near the site of a protest when he was arrested the previous evening.\n\nMacaire, who was released shortly after Iranian diplomatic officials learned of his arrest, tweeted that he had attended what was advertised as a vigil, left as it began to turn into a protest and was detained half-an-hour later. The Tasnim news agency, which is linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, reported on Sunday that Macaire had been using a shop near the protests as a place of “coordination”.\n\nThe British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, condemned the ambassador’s arrest as a “flagrant violation of international law” and said Iran was marching towards “pariah status”.\n\nIn a series of tweets in English and Farsi, the US president Donald Trump said he was monitoring demonstrations in the country and voiced his support – sentiments that analysts have said are unlikely to win the protesters favours.\n\n“To the brave, long-suffering people of Iran: I’ve stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency, and my Administration will continue to stand with you,” he tweeted. “There can not be another massacre of peaceful protesters, nor an internet shutdown. The world is watching.”\n\nAfter days of denials, Iranian officials on Saturday morning admitted to shooting down the Ukrain International Airlines jet, a few hours after firing missiles at US forces stationed in Iraq and while the country’s air defences were on high alert for reprisals.\n\n“The Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets this disastrous mistake. My thoughts and prayers go to all the mourning families,” Iranian president Hassan Rouhani said.\n\nAfter the missile operation in Iraq, US military flights around Iranian borders increased and Iranian military officials reported seeing aerial targets coming toward strategic centres, a statement by Iranian armed forces headquarters said.\n\n“The aircraft came close to a sensitive IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] military centre at an altitude and flight condition that resembled hostile targeting,” the statement said. “Under these circumstances, the aircraft was unintentionally hit, which unfortunately resulted in the death of many Iranian and foreign nationals.”\n\nThe victims include 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians, 10 Swedes, four Afghans, three Germans and three British nationals.",
