          "body": "<p>The American actor Selma Blair has been praised for speaking candidly about having multiple sclerosis (MS).</p> <p>In an<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BpKjP_7FnWQ/?utm_source=ig_embed\"> Instagram post</a> the 46-year-old Cruel Intentions star said she had been officially diagnosed in August but had experienced symptoms for years.</p> <p>“I am disabled. I fall sometimes. I drop things. My memory is foggy. And my left side is asking for directions from a broken GPS,” she wrote. “But we are doing it. And I laugh and I don’t know exactly what I will do precisely but I will do my best.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/multiple-sclerosis/\">Multiple sclerosis</a> is a lifelong condition, which can affect the brain or spinal cord. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance.</p> <p>According to the NHS, it is two to three times more likely in women than men and is usually diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s.</p> <p>Blair, who will appear in the Netflix series Another Life, said the “profound” help she received from costume designer Allisa Swanson had inspired her to speak openly about her condition.</p> <p>“[S]he carefully gets my legs in my pants, pulls my tops over my head, buttons my coats and offers her shoulder to steady myself. I have <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/multiplesclerosis/\">#multiplesclerosis</a>,” she wrote.</p> <p>“I am in the thick of it but I hope to give some hope to others. And even to myself. You can’t get help unless you ask. It can be overwhelming in the beginning. You want to sleep. You always want to sleep. So I don’t have answers. You see, I want to sleep. But I am a forthcoming person and I want my life to be full somehow.”</p> <p>There is no cure for MS but symptoms can sometimes be managed with painkillers or drugs to reduce nerve inflammation, physical therapy to ease muscle stiffness or medication to slow progression.</p> <p>Genevieve Edwards, director of external affairs at the MS Society, said many people living with MS would be grateful for Blair’s decision to speak out.</p> <p>“She’ll raise vital awareness of a condition that affects more than 100,000 people in the UK,” she said. “MS is unpredictable and different for everyone so, as the actress revealed, you can live with symptoms for years and not receive a diagnosis.”</p> <p>There is no cure for MS but thereare a range of treatments available for the relapsing form of the condition, as well as new research-led developments happening all the time, Edwards added.</p> <p>According to the NHS, more than eight in 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the relapsing remitting type. A person with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, which can occur without warning but are sometimes associated with periods of illness or stress. These can worsen and last for days, weeks or months, then slowly improve over a similar time period.</p> <p>“What’s most encouraging about Selma’s post is the attitude of her colleagues. Having the right support around you is crucial because when your employer takes time to understand MS, you can enjoy a full working life for as long as you want or are able to.”</p> <p>Blair discussed the support she had received from her producers, writing: “By the grace of the lord, and will power and the understanding producers at Netflix , I have a job.

          "bodyText": "The American actor Selma Blair has been praised for speaking candidly about having multiple sclerosis (MS). In an Instagram post the 46-year-old Cruel Intentions star said she had been officially diagnosed in August but had experienced symptoms for years. “I am disabled. I fall sometimes. I drop things. My memory is foggy. And my left side is asking for directions from a broken GPS,” she wrote. “But we are doing it. And I laugh and I don’t know exactly what I will do precisely but I will do my best.” Multiple sclerosis is a lifelong condition, which can affect the brain or spinal cord. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance. According to the NHS, it is two to three times more likely in women than men and is usually diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s. Blair, who will appear in the Netflix series Another Life, said the “profound” help she received from costume designer Allisa Swanson had inspired her to speak openly about her condition. “[S]he carefully gets my legs in my pants, pulls my tops over my head, buttons my coats and offers her shoulder to steady myself. I have #multiplesclerosis,” she wrote. “I am in the thick of it but I hope to give some hope to others. And even to myself. You can’t get help unless you ask. It can be overwhelming in the beginning. You want to sleep. You always want to sleep. So I don’t have answers. You see, I want to sleep. But I am a forthcoming person and I want my life to be full somehow.” There is no cure for MS but symptoms can sometimes be managed with painkillers or drugs to reduce nerve inflammation, physical therapy to ease muscle stiffness or medication to slow progression. Genevieve Edwards, director of external affairs at the MS Society, said many people living with MS would be grateful for Blair’s decision to speak out. “She’ll raise vital awareness of a condition that affects more than 100,000 people in the UK,” she said. “MS is unpredictable and different for everyone so, as the actress revealed, you can live with symptoms for years and not receive a diagnosis.” There is no cure for MS but thereare a range of treatments available for the relapsing form of the condition, as well as new research-led developments happening all the time, Edwards added. According to the NHS, more than eight in 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the relapsing remitting type. A person with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, which can occur without warning but are sometimes associated with periods of illness or stress. These can worsen and last for days, weeks or months, then slowly improve over a similar time period. “What’s most encouraging about Selma’s post is the attitude of her colleagues. Having the right support around you is crucial because when your employer takes time to understand MS, you can enjoy a full working life for as long as you want or are able to.” Blair discussed the support she had received from her producers, writing: “By the grace of the lord, and will power and the understanding producers at Netflix , I have a job. A wonderful job.” Her producer Noreen Halpern assured her “everyone has something”. Blair added that all members of the crew had been supportive. Many living with the condition sent words of support to Blair on social media, including journalist Victoria Brownworth, who wrote on Twitter: The actor and activist Rose McGowan also tweeted her best wishes, writing: “You are a stellar being, Selma Blair. Your truth and honesty will help so many. Blessings on your journey.”",

We regard it as unacceptable that the UK government not only remains silent, but actively enables this Saudi regime.” The UK, the letter goes on, “has continued to supply Saudi Arabia with weaponry which has been used in the devastating war in Yemen, has shamefully rolled out the red carpet for the Saudi crown prince in a state visit earlier this year, and has repeatedly excused their actions in statements before the House of Commons”. While some concern expressed about the Khashoggi case and other moves were welcome, the signatories wrote, “the time for rhetoric and photocalls is over – it’s time to act”. The letter calls for a full condemnation of Saudi Arabia’s “reckless and barbaric” behaviour; a suspension of arms sales for use in Yemen pending an investigation of alleged war crimes; a halt to UK military operations in Saudi; details on what diplomatic representations had been made to the Saudis, and support for an independent inquiry into Khashoggi’s fate. The Foreign Office was contacted for a response.",

The incident happened as the Red Falcon ferry was attempting to berth at the entrance to the harbour, according to the coastguard, which received a 999 call from a man reporting that he had heard cries for help from the scene. All 56 people on board the ferry, which is operated by Red Funnel on the company’s route from Southampton to East Cowes, were safe and well. It remained grounded at the entrance to the harbour on Sunday morning and tugs were in attendance. Three lifeboats were launched to search for people in the water after the reported collision at around 8am. A coastguard search and rescue helicopter had been searching the area but had to turn back because of low visibility. A spokesman for the ferry company said: “The 0700 vehicle ferry sailing from Southampton to East Cowes came into contact with several small yachts whilst entering Cowes harbour at 0800 this morning in dense fog. “The ship is currently aground but is watertight and no injuries have been sustained to any of the 40 passengers on board.” The company said there were no reports of any injuries to anyone involved in the incident. “Attempts to refloat the vessel are currently under way on a falling tide.

One account from a member of the public suggested that a moored boat had been sunk as the ferry missed the harbour channel and ran aground. Images posted on Twitter appeared to show the mast of a sunken boat sticking out from the water with a Red Funnel ferry in the background. Three boats were cut adrift when another ferry operated by Red Funnel went through moorings in thick fog at Cowes harbour on 27 September, the RNLI said last month. The ferry involved on that occasion was the Red Eagle, which was sailing from East Cowes to Southampton. A catamaran was hit and two yachts were later found drifting outside the harbour following the incident, which happened at around 5.30am. Red Funnel said that it was withdrawing the ferry from service. Red Funnel, which styles itself as the “original Isle of Wight ferry operator”, carries 3.4 million passengers each year.

They are trying to talk to a lot of those communities that are directly affected by policy changes.

          "bodyText": "“We believe capitalism must regain its human face, and that conviction deeply influenced our decision.” So said Winston Peters, the kingmaker politician who lent his support a year ago to Labour’s rising star, Jacinda Ardern, after a decade of conservative National party government. “For too many New Zealanders capitalism has not been their friend but their foe,” he said. Peters’ choice thrust the then 37-year-old into the spotlight, sparked the “Jacindamania” phenomenon, and set the clock ticking as voters awaited the dramatic change her party had promised. Ending child poverty. Bringing kindness and empathy to politics. Tackling climate change and improving the lives of New Zealand’s most vulnerable people. The ambitious pledges kept coming. “Today is a new beginning” said Ardern in her first speech as prime minister to parliament. “The status quo is not good enough and we will not settle for it.” Concrete action has included increases to paid parental leave, boosting the accomodation allowance for welfare recipients, and an increase in the refugee quota. And Ardern has consistently remained New Zealand’s preferred leader in the polls since being sworn in, but solutions to some of the nation’s problems remain elusive. As the months have slipped by it has become hard for New Zealanders to see evidence of transformative change in their day-to-day lives. Petrol prices are at a record high, synthetic cannabis deaths are soaring and tens of thousands of teachers and nurses have gone on strike for the first time in decades. A plethora of working groups and reviews have prompted the catch-cry: “less hui [meetings] more do-ey”. Joe Carolan, an organiser at Unite Union which represents many low-paid workers, says there is “huge anger” about the high cost of housing and transport, and many workers feel betrayed that a Labour-led government is not doing enough, fast enough to improve their everyday lives. “We’re gearing up a for a big round of strikes in 2019 that is coming with the new mood … there seems to be a hundred working groups about everything, and any change seems to be token,” says Carolan. “It’s been nearly a year since we had the government, and most people would say the housing and transport situation has got worse.” While Ardern continues to win plaudits on the global stage, her star power has also started to wane in the domestic media, with commentators calling the prime minister out for lacking control of her ministers after two were fired in quick succession, for failing to unite her coalition partners, and for allowing Peters – her foreign affairs minister and deputy PM – to run rogue. Headlines expressing concern about Ardern’s leadership style have started to emerge, accusing the prime minister of weakness. Dr Claire Timperley, a political scientist at Victoria University, describes Ardern’s first year in office as a “magical year” full of firsts and freshness, but also challenges: “At this point there has been more promise than action.” Professor Jennifer Curtin, director of the public policy institute and a professor of politics at Auckland university, argues that the slow pace is proof that Ardern’s government is aiming for true transformational change, and isn’t interested in “tinkering” with the status quo. But if there aren’t more short-term wins voters could start to feel let down, that their lives aren’t materially improving, she said. “People aren’t going to be convinced by a wellbeing budget if the wellbeing budget only delivers for a generation in 10 years’ time,” says Curtin. ‘They are actually engaging with people’ A number of public inquiries – including a mental health inquiry and the justice advisory group – are travelling to regional centres around the country for public consultations, a method that Curtin says shows a departure from previous government’s heavy reliance on management consultants. But the working groups and reviews are slow, expensive and time-consuming, and make it difficult for voters to measure quantifiable outcomes, or pinpoint concrete improvements. “These reviews are giving opportunity to groups that traditionally don’t have privileged access to government. They are trying to talk to a lot of those communities that are directly affected by policy changes. And I am not sure we have seen it done in that way for quite a long time,” says Curtin. “They are also seeking different avenues and channels of expertise. They see experts in different places. If you are going to do transformation, you have to know what is actually going to transform people’s lives.” Dr Ang Jury, chief executive of Women’s Refuge New Zealand says there is such increased activity in the sector “it just about makes your head spin”. She cites an overhaul of the welfare system and the progression of the child poverty reduction bill as significant wins. “There is a lot of talk, but it is consultative talk, rather than just the ministry going blah blah blah, or a minister going blah blah blah. They are actually engaging with people,” says Ang. “And after a year we’re starting to see some promising signs.” Timperley says although Ardern’s rhetoric is “soaringly aspirational” it needs to be to create the level of societal change she is aiming for, and there is strong evidence her government is walking the talk. Ardern’s commitment to making politics kinder and more empathetic is shown by her refusal to capitalise on mistakes made by opposition leader Simon Bridges, Timperley says, her candid Facebook Live videos, and her willingness to nail her colours to the mast and be held to account. “She is putting her neck out by saying ‘I want to claim kindness’ – kindnesses can also be interpreted as weaknesses,” says Timperley. “I think she is being very intentional in trying to change the language around leadership, and saying actually you can be kind and you can also be strong.” Political observers agree Ardern’s rejection of traditional leadership styles has seen her subjected to a range of gendered criticism, including the recurrent refrain that she is “inexperienced” – despite having three more years in parliament than former PM John Key – and insinuations that she is overloaded and “struggling to keep up with her job.” The plethora of firsts under this government – youngest leader, first PM to have a baby, first pregnant leader to speak on tribal grounds – is also proving unsettling for conservatives, says Curtin, and Ardern has unwittingly become caught up with the growing backlash against strong feminist voices and the MeToo and Time’s Up movements. “There is a core element inside New Zealand that is still struggling with the fact that she’s had a baby,” says Curtin. “There is a multitude of newness that everybody is still going … woah.” In the social justice arena, the government has definitely “changed the tone”, says Dr Emily Keddell, a senior lecturer in social work at the University of Otago, and ushered in a new phase of respect and empathy towards those receiving welfare help and the country’s most vulnerable people. An entire overhaul of the welfare system is also underway, but the immediate, superficial changes introduced are indicative of a shift away from shame to one of possibility, Keddell says. “They are certainly responding to poverty in a more humane way then we have seen with previous governments. In the area of child poverty they are trying very hard to respond to the issue in a meaningful way,” says Keddell. In Northland new mother Jaime Faulkner, 36, is adamant her life has improved in the past year. Extended paid-parental leave, and a new best start payment of NZ$60 (£30) a week for her baby’s first year have made “a serious difference”, she says, and allowed her to spend more time with her daughter, and buy necessities such as nappies and clothes. Faulkner says MPs in her region attend more community events, speak more te reo Māori and have shifted the focus to telling stories of Māori successes, rather than struggles. Asked to sum up the new government in one word Faulkner doesn’t skip a beat while her daughter squeals for attention in the background. “Supportive,” she says.",
