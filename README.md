# News Digest

## Brief

The purpose of this project was to create a single-page web app, written purely in frontend code (without using any libraries or frameworks), which grabs and also summarises all the daily news from The Guardian newspaper API.

## Technologies used:

JavaScript

## User Stories

Some of these stories will need decomposing if they seem too large.
