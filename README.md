## API

### API authentication

So that this project can focus on the front-end, we've provided an API that you can use to talk to the Guardian API and the Aylien text summarisation API.  This API's only job is to take your request and add an API key.  This way, you don't have to store API keys in your front-end app.

> Why is it bad to store API keys in your front-end?  If we hadn't provided this API for you to use, how would you avoid this?

### API request rate limits and stubbing

The Guardian and Aylien text summarisation APIs are severely rate-limited.

**Please stub your tests so we don't exceed the daily limit.  Otherwise, all requests will be rejected and everyone's apps will stop working!**

### API Overview

The basic idea is to send an `apiRequestUrl` query parameter to the News Summary API.  The value of this parameter is the URL of the request you *would* have made to the Guardian or Aylien API, minus any API credentials.

### Guardian API example

**Please stub your tests to avoid exceeding the API rate limit**

If you wanted to get the content of an article from the Guardian API, this is the cURL request you might make.  Notice how it has a query parameter for `api-key`.

```
curl "http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2014/feb/17/alex-salmond-speech-first-minister-scottish-independence-eu-currency-live?show-fields=body&api-key=SECRET_API_KEY"
```

To make this request via the Makers News Summary API with cURL, you could do something like this:

```
curl "http://news-summary-api.herokuapp.com/guardian?apiRequestUrl=http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2014/feb/17/alex-salmond-speech-first-minister-scottish-independence-eu-currency-live?show-fields=body"
```

Note how the `apiRequestUrl` parameter value is just the request you would have made to the Guardian API, minus `api-key`.

### Aylien text summarisation API example

**Please stub your tests to avoid exceeding the API rate limit**

If you wanted to use the Aylien API to summarise an article by Bret Victor, this is the cURL request you might make.  Notice how it has headers to authenticate with the Aylien API.

```
curl "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/summarize?url=http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/note.html" \
  -H "X-AYLIEN-TextAPI-Application-ID: APPLICATION_ID" \
  -H "X-AYLIEN-TextAPI-Application-Key: SECRET_APPLICATION_KEY"
```

To make this request via the Makers News Summary API with cURL, you could do something like this.

```
curl "http://news-summary-api.herokuapp.com/aylien?apiRequestUrl=https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/summarize?url=http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/note.html"
```

Note how the `apiRequestUrl` parameter is just the request you would have made to the Aylien API.  Notice how you don't have to send authentication headers.
