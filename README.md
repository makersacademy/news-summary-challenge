# News challenge

A weekend challenge from the [Makers]('https://makers.tech/) bootcamp.

## Challenge

As usual please start by forking this repo.

You'll create an app that shows the latest news using the Guardian API. You'll find
instructions on how to setup and use the API down this page.

## Project overview

Your app will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a
page. Clicking on a headline will link the user to the actual article page on the Guardian's website.

### Technologies

You'll write a single page web app. You'll write your code in frontend JavaScript, CSS and
HTML. You won't use Ruby or backend JavaScript.

You're strongly encouraged to use the same tools and libraries you've been learning this
week:

- Jest to write your tests
- The [`jest-fetch-mock`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-fetch-mock) module (or
  similar) to mock `fetch` requests (so you don't request the API when running tests!)
- A build tool such as `esbuild` to bundle files together

## User Stories

Some of these stories will need decomposing if they seem too large.

```bash
As a busy politician
So I know what the big stories of the day are
I can see all of today's headlines in one place
```

```bash
As a busy politician
So that I have something nice to look at
I can see a relevant picture to illustrate each news article when I browse headlines
```

```bash
As a busy politician
So I can get a few more details about an important story
I can click a news article title which links to the original article
```

```bash
As a busy politician
So I can search what I want to read about
I can specify a search query on the page and get articles matching this search
```

### Stretch user stories

```bash
As a busy politician
So I can quickly read through the essential of today's stories
I can see a summarised version of of the article
```

To get a summary of an article's content, you'll need to use the [Aylien API
endpoint](https://docs.aylien.com/textapi/endpoints/#summarization), which means
integrating and calling another HTTP endpoint from a different API. This mean you'll need
to first fetch articles from the Guardian API, **then** use the Aylien API to summarise
the content — you'll need to use promises or callbacks to call both APIs and to handle the flow of
control.

```bash
As a busy politician
Just in case my laptop breaks
I can read the site comfortably on my phone
```

```bash
As a busy politician
So I make my news reading more fun
I can see whizzy animations in the app
```

## API

### API authentication

You'll need to [register and get an API
key](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/) to use the Guardian API.

### API request rate limits and stubbing

The Guardian API is severely rate-limited.

**Please stub your tests so we don't exceed the daily limit. Otherwise, all requests will
be rejected and everyone's apps will stop working!**

## Guardian API Overview

**Remember to mock `fetch` in your tests to avoid exceeding the API rate limit**

If you wanted to get the latest articles from the Guardian API, this is the cURL request
you might make. Notice how it has a query parameter for `api-key`.

```bash
curl "https://content.guardianapis.com/search?q=&query-fields=headline&show-fields=thumbnail,headline,byline&order-by=newest&api-key=test"
```

Also notice that the URL parameter `q` is empty — we can pass in a search string to filter
the returned articles, for example to search articles containing "America" in the title:

```bash
curl "https://content.guardianapis.com/search?q=America&query-fields=headline&show-fields=thumbnail,headline,byline&order-by=newest&api-key=test"
```

The above request will return a response similar to this one:
