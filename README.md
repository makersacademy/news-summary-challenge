# News Summary Challenge

This challenge was to create a news summary web app build with only JavaScript, html, and CSS.

To try out the app, clone this repo:

```git clone git@github.com:alittlecross/bowling-challenge.git```

And run `index.html` from that folder.

HOWEVER - the will only work if you save a Guardian API key in a file within that folder call `api-key.js`, like so:

```var apiKey = "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm";```

## Screenshots ##

When running, when viewing the homepage, it should look like this in browser:

And like this on a mobile:

When viewing an article summary, it should look like this in browser:

## Testing ##

All code has been testing with my own testing framework, Spectrum.

In the repo that you cloned, run `Spectrum.html` from the `Spectrum` folder.
