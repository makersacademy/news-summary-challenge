### Testing Framework

I called mine Peter. Peter is a cute cat that looks at you in a judging way when you run your tests, no matter if they're passing or failing, therefore making you question the validity of everything you've just done. He meows in a scottish accent.
One day Peter will actually be useful and test something. But not today. Peter is too busy hunting bugs.
