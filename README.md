# News challenge

This is the weekend challenge from week 7 at Makers Academy. To read the challenge's instructions, refer to [this file](CHALLENGE.md)

## Approach

* This was my very first time building a front-end application with the use of APIs
* The application uses The Guardian API to access news articles from their website and display them on the screen
* This is a one page application, meaning the articles are added dynamically to the page with Javascript
* I used three different classes/JS files for separation of concerns
* Playing with CSS was quite fun

## Reflections/Difficulties 

* Testing can feel very abstract whem most of the output is being mocked
* It was hard to separate the responsibilities in between Model and View
* CSS styling is a whole new world and can be very tricky (but also fun)

## Improvements/To dos

* Would be nice to add the option to see further pages with articles, as at the moment you can only see the first ten.
* Make the page mobile friendly
* Add the article summarization feature
* Deploy the page and have it running on the web
