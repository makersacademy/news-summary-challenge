<img width="378" alt="Screenshot 2022-05-09 at 07 28 54" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99490100/167352660-d41ae831-cfe0-42ea-a3d8-649062d878ae.png">

I have created an app that shows the latest news using the Guardian API. You'll find
instructions on how to setup and use the API down this page.

This app grabs all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a
page. Clicking on a headline links the user to the actual article page on the Guardian's website.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

You will need to clone the repo. 

The step will be

```
git clone https://github.com/baljitrakhra/news-summary-challenge.git
```
You will need to use you own Guardian news API key.

Save it in the file called apiKey.js
There is only one line of code in this file 

```
module.exports = API key;
```

Please make sure to add apiKey.js file to your .gitignore

```
npm install 
npm run build
open index.html
```
You will be able to see the following page in your web browser

## Running the tests

To run the automated tests for this system

Run the following command from terminal in the parent directory 

```
jest
```


### Technologies

This app is built with following technologies, tools and libraries:
 * Jest to write your tests
 * The [`jest-fetch-mock`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-fetch-mock) module (or
   similar) to mock `fetch` requests (so you don't request the API when running tests!)
 * A build tool such as `esbuild` to bundle files together

## User Stories

Some of these stories will need decomposing if they seem too large.

```
As a busy politician
So I know what the big stories of the day are
I can see all of today's headlines in one place
```

```
As a busy politician
So that I have something nice to look at
I can see a relevant picture to illustrate each news article when I browse headlines
```

```
As a busy politician
So I can get a few more details about an important story
I can click a news article title which links to the original article
```

```
As a busy politician
So I can search what I want to read about
I can specify a search query on the page and get articles matching this search
```

## API

### API authentication

You'll need to [register and get an API
key](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/) to use the Guardian API. 

### API request rate limits and stubbing

The Guardian API is severely rate-limited.

**Please stub your tests so we don't exceed the daily limit.  Otherwise, all requests will
be rejected and everyone's apps will stop working!**

## Guardian API Overview

**Remember to mock `fetch` in your tests to avoid exceeding the API rate limit**

If you wanted to get the latest articles from the Guardian API, this is the cURL request
you might make. Notice how it has a query parameter for `api-key`.

```
curl "https://content.guardianapis.com/search?q=&query-fields=headline&show-fields=thumbnail,headline,byline&order-by=newest&api-key=test"
```

Also notice that the URL parameter `q` is empty ‚Äî we can pass in a search string to filter
the returned articles, for example to search articles containing "America" in the title:

```
curl "https://content.guardianapis.com/search?q=America&query-fields=headline&show-fields=thumbnail,headline,byline&order-by=newest&api-key=test"
```

The above request will return a response similar to this one:
```json
