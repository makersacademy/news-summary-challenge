## Project Overview

On loading this app displays the 10 most recent articles publish to the [Guardian News API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/). From there each you are able to click on each link to take you through to the article.

There is search functionality in the top right of the page that allows the user to search by a topic. In the demo video below you can see it returns the ten most recent searches for "Sports" related articles.

Addtionally, the page is responsive to the screensize or window resizing.

## Planning

When given the project brief my approach was to breakdown the user stories into their Nouns and Verbs, relate those into Classes or Functions/Features and from there create a mock up of what I was aiming for.

This helped me to think through the process, look ahead for any potential issues and gave me a high leve of plan of how to begin the TDD process.

## Features

- User can view the most recent headlines on one page
- User can search stories based on a topic of interest
- Each story displays its corresponding image
- Webpage is fully responsive to screensize
- Hover over an image provides a small animation
- Clicking the article takes the user to the story

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone this rep
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Sign up for the [Guardian News API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/) to generate an API key.
4. Create a config.js file
5. Add your API key in `const apiKey = {apiKey :"API KEY HERE"};` and export this with `module.exports = apiKey;`
6. Enter `npm run build` in your terminal
7. Enter `open index.html` in a separate terminal

This will open the site in your browser

## Test Coverage
