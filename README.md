## News Summary Challenge - Chuka Okoye-Ahaneku

### My Approach:
* Managed pull data from The Guardian API, and transfer headlines onto my website.
* Next step was to make a single-page app that holds the article information, but was unable to pull article information also, just links that lead to webpage.

### How to run:
```
git clone https://github.com/coo990/news-summary-challenge.git
cd news-summary-challenge
open index.html
```
