# News Summary challenge

## Project overview

Your app will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

### Technologies

You'll write a single page web app.  You'll write your code in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML.  You won't use Ruby or backend JavaScript.
