### Stretch user stories

```
As a busy politician
So I can quickly read through the essential of today's stories
I can see a summarised version of of the article 
```

To get a summary of an article's content, you'll need to use the [Aylien API
endpoint](https://docs.aylien.com/textapi/endpoints/#summarization), which means
integrating and calling another HTTP endpoint from a different API. This mean you'll need
to first fetch articles from the Guardian API, **then** use the Aylien API to summarise
the content â€” you'll need to use promises or callbacks to call both APIs and to handle the flow of
control.

```
As a busy politician
Just in case my laptop breaks
I can read the site comfortably on my phone
```

```
As a busy politician
So I make my news reading more fun
