## Progress

I was able to implement the list of headlines, which appear automatically, and the headlines also function as links which on clicking, generate the article summary below, however, I was unable to properly implement the thumbnail along with the article, nor was I put in styling or animation, in future, I would like to come back to this project to finish the remaining user stories
