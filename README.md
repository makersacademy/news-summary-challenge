# News Summary challenge

Week 7 Makers Academy weekend challenge. The task is as follows:

"Your app will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page. You will write a single page web app. You'll write your code in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML. You won't use Ruby or backend JavaScript.

You won't use any libraries or frameworks. But, feel free to use the test framework you wrote during the week!"

### Using this app
* Clone this repo
* Install node if you haven't installed already
* From the command line, run `npm install http-server`
* You will need to sign up for a Guardian API key = https://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/
* In the `scripts.js` file, replace the text `api key` with your API key from The Guardian. Add `&show-fields=thumbnail` to the end of this request URL to see pictures displayed. Save the file.
* Enter `node node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server` from the command line and you will see a list of the latest headlines displayed:

## What I gained from this challenge
I chose to attempt this challenge for the following reasons:
* I wanted more experience using APIs and understanding them. After following a tutorial and successfully connecting to The Guardian's API, I am happy that I have a better understanding of how they work and what is happening.
* After this week's Notes-App challenge, I wanted to practice vanilla JavaScript.
* This challenge helped me towards the goals **I can learn by myself** and **I can debug anything**. I have never tried to use an API in this context and doing so was quite challenging. It gave me the opportunity to debug new types of errors and I used `console.log()` a lot to gain visibility.

## To work on
I am happy that an MVP has been achieved but I would like to work on the following:

* I spiked this app - I would like to write tests for it. My reason for doing this was because my main goals were to practice JavaScript and improve my  understanding of APIs and I felt that spiking the app better served these goals. However, I would like to try and TDD this and stub my tests to avoid exceeding the daily limit.
* I would also like to figure out how to encrypt my API key.

## User Stories

## Build Status
I believe I have achieved an MVP here. All the headlines, summaries, links and pictures display on one page, categorised into the type of news that they are e.g. "Sport", "Politics" etc. Out of the user stories, I have successfully completed the first 4 but have not incorporated animations.
