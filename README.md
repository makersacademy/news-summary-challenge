# Maker's Week 7: Weekend challenge
This challenge was the seventh of my Maker's weekend challenge, intended to be done alone to reinforce the week's learning and concepts.
The necessary skills covered in this challenge were:

* Build a dynamic single page app using only Pure JS
* Request and use data from an external API
* Explain that libraries are code 

Successes
-----

* Able to have asynchronous JS handle the creation and display of data from an external API
* Able to successfully debug toggle visibility bug despite a lack of error messaging/ information from the program
* Program is able to get and render data all without any back-end JS code


To improve
-----
* Lack of time and fatigue from previous week meant styling only got as far as a making a basic flex box and a button
* Summary finder method needs refactoring to allow summaries to be loaded with the initial request and stored, so allow more seamless single article rendering


### Serving your app

Project is setup to use VScode's Live-Server extension to provide simple launching and automatic reloading.
