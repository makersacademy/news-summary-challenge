News Summary Challenge
==================

Makker's Academy weekend challenge to create a single-page frontend JavaScript app, without using any libraries or frameworks (including for testing).


## Requirements 

- A modern web browser


## Instructions

The app is available at https://ealitten.github.io/news-summary-challenge/

(N.B. The API is fairly slow, so the articles may take a few seconds to load).


## Approach

Producing this app in vanilla JS without the use of frameworks made simple tasks such as AJAX requests more difficult and time-consuming to implement, although was greatly beneficial to my learning. Unfortunately difficulties getting the API to work meant I ran out of time to complete the project on the weekend - below are the improvements I would make given the opportunity to revisit the project. 


## User Stories implemented

```
As a busy politician
I can see all of today's headlines in one place
So I know what the big stories of the day are
```

```
As a busy politician
I can click a link to see the original news article
So that I can get an in depth understanding of a very important story
```


## To do

```
As a busy politician
I can see a summary of a news article
So I can get a few more details about an important story
```

```
As a busy politician
I can see a picture to illustrate each news article when I browse headlines
So that I have something nice to look at
```

```
As a busy politician
I can read the site comfortably on my phone
Just in case my laptop breaks
```

```
As a busy politician
I can see whizzy animations in the app
To make my news reading more fun
```

1. Expand a summary of the article when you click on it, produced using the aylien API
2. Add thumbnails to illustrate stories
3. Make the design responsive through use of CSS
