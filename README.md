# New Summary

This was the seventh weekend challenge at Makers. It reinforced what I had learnt in the weeks work - working competently with, and building a front end web app in JavaScript. This apphas a 'serverless' architecture, as I only needed a static web server to run the app - the API is hosted on an external server.

I followed the brief when making this news app:

First, I focused on making clean code that was encapsulated, had a single responsibility and was DRY, all with a good file structure. Each object was injected into the corrosponding 'class' All of the code was test driven, using a library I had made myself.

I enjoyed this weekends challenge. I focused first of all on using the weeks afternoon challenge and refactoring it into a concise and DRY program with seperate .js files. I then focused on inheritance and injecting into each 'class' rather than instantiating new objects at each parent occurance. After building the basic framework, I then focused on breaking down the user stories and using the guardian API to access the information I needed.

## How to Run

Clone this repo, from the command line navigate to the [_news-summary-challenge_](news-summary-challenge) directory and in the command line type:

```
npm install
```

Once the dependancies are installed, Right click on the [_index_](index.html) file, click `copy path` and paste this into the Google Chrome browser to run the app. The top 10 articles currently on the Guardian site will appear.

### Testing

This App uses a test library I made myself, using the [_assert_](assert.js) function to test for truthyness. To check the test suite, right click, and click on `Inspect` to open up the Chrome Developer Tools. Click on the console tab at the top. Ypu will see 8 messages indicating the tests have passed.

## Brief

The app will grab the top 10 headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on the homepage. Each of the 10 news articles shows the corrosponding image of the story above the link. Clicking on the link will take you to the news article on the Guardian Website. **Summary?**
