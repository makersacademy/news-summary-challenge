Create a single page web app that summarises the news. It sources all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  
Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article, using the Aylien text summary API.

This app is based on the Makers weekend challenge 7. [Click here](https://github.com/makersacademy/news-summary-challenge) for the original README.md.
