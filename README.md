# The Day Today

## Description

This app grabs the top 10 headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and displays them on the homepage. Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article and then allow the user to click through to the full article on the Guardian website.
This single page web app uses pure JavaScript with HTML and CSS.
See more about my [design process](#design-process).

`git clone git@github.com:ewintram/news-summary-challenge.git`


## Usage

To launch the app use a static server e.g.
[http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server))

Navigate to http://localhost:8080
