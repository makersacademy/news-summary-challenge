# News Summary challenge

The app allows people to see the headlines from the Guardian using their API. This was a challenge set by Makers Academy. I implemented the following user stories:

| Completed | User Stories         |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| [x]       | As a busy politician |

I can see all of today's headlines in one place
So I know what the big stories of the day are|
| [x] | As a busy politician
I can see a relevant picture to illustrate each news article when I browse headlines
So that I have something nice to look at
