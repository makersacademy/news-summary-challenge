# News Summary challenge

You'll create an app that summarises the news.Your app will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

## Approach

I first structured off the week's challenge to get the foundation setup. Once I did that, I then
started adding in the API and re-edited my code to apply for that. I believe I managed to get halfway
with getting the api data but haven't executed it fully via callbacks. Will return to this project
when I have the time to do so.

## User Stories

Some of these stories will need decomposing if they seem too large.
