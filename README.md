# News Summary challenge

The application calls two APIs: first, the Guardian to fetch the day's headlines, then the Aylien API to provide a summary of each article's full text. 

### To run 
* Clone this repo and navigate to the root folder
* Open `index.html` in your browser!

#### Running the tests

The projects uses a simple custom testing framework, built in vanilla JS, which outputs to the JavaScript console. Open `test-runner.html` in your browser and open developer tools to see the results. 

### My approach

My focus for this project was on building an MVC front end, and doing OOD with the JavaScript prototype model. 

I spent a while diagramming to understand what was needed, then built each object test-first using the custom testing framework.
