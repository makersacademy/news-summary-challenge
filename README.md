### Technologies used

- Front-end JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Sharona - a test framework I built for this project whilst in Girona, with the Knack's "My Sharona" on permanent rotation in my head


### Personal motivation

- Further learn single page app architecture and implementation
- More exposure to and practice of vanilla JavaScript
- Write a JavaScript test framework, and to use JavaScript without frameworks or libraries
