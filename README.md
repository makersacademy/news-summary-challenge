# News Summary challenge

A single page web app that provides a summary of the day's top news headlines.

## Project overview

This app grabs all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline shows a summary of the article.

### Technologies

The app has been written in frontend Javascript, HTML and CSS. No other libraries or frameworks have been used.

### Getting Started

* Clone this repo
* To run the app, open the news.html file in your browser
* To run the tests, open the testRunner.html file in your browser


## API

### API authentication

So that this project coule focus on the front-end, Makers provided an API that was used to talk to the Guardian API and the Aylien text summarisation API.  This API's only job is to take a request and add an API key.  This way, I did not have to store API keys in my front-end app.

### Code

If you're interested, you can see the code for the News Summary API in this repo: https://github.com/makersacademy/news-summary-api
