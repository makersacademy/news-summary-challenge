# News Summary challenge

## Project overview

A single page web app that will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

### Technologies

Written in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

### Serving your app

Uses the static web server [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to serve the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. 

## User Stories

Some of these stories will need decomposing if they seem too large.
