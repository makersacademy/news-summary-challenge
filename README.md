# News Summary App

### Description

### Tech Stack

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- http-server (Static web server)
- Makers News Summary API (The Guardian & Ayelian text summarisation API's)
- Self made test framework
- ESLint (AirBnb Style guide)

### Instructions

- Clone the app & install the packages:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Danielandro/news-summary-challenge.git
$ cd news-summary-challenge
$ npm install
```

- Register for an API key from [News API](https://newsapi.org/).

- You must create this file: `src/apiKeys.js` and add the key with this format:  
   `const newsApiKey = 'YOUR-NEWS-API-KEY';`

- Run the server `npm start`

- Open the app at `http://localhost:8080/`

#### Run tests

Go to the project directory in the terminal.

Run `open specRunner.html` (for Linux/Bash on Windows, run `xdg-open specRunner.html`)

Once it opens in your browser, open up your developer tools and click on the `console` tab. Passing tests print out in green, failing tests will be red.
