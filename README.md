# News Summary challenge

## Challenge

You'll create an app that summarises the news.

Your app will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

## Instructions

- Clone the repo
- Currently app runs on stored data to not send unecessary api requests during development
- A typical api get request response was stored in request.js
- Uncomment the second fetchAsync function to run a real get request and get recent news stories

## Technologies

- Single page web app written purely with frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML
- Guardian and Aylien API

## TODO

- Testing get request was sent successfully
- Making a responsive page for mobile https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp
- Adding some animations

## User Stories

Some of these stories will need decomposing if they seem too large.
