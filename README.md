# News Summary challenge

Check out [here](http://makers-news-today.surge.sh)

A single-page web app that summarises the news using the Guardian API and Aylien APIs, using Javascript, HTML and CSS. 

## Key Features
* Show 10 latest headlines from Guardian 
* Click on the title to see a summary using modal
* Click on the summary title to go to the guardian article
* Responsive to mobile screen size

## Main challenge
* Fetching the Guardian API was straightforward but creating the multiple modals to dynamically show summary page was the biggest challenge I faced.
* Since the Aylien API has a low API request limit (as it is directed via Makers API), in case of API fetch failure, I have replaced the summary text with the full article body.
