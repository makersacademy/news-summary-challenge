News Summary Challenge
======================

Summary
-------

A one page web app that summarises the news and draws on the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and displays them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article. This repo is just a placeholder with no implementation possible due to limited time to complete the challenge. If more time is available later in the course I will look to complete the implementation.
