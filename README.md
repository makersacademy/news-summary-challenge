# The Day Today

## Description

This app grabs the top 10 headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and displays them on the homepage. Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article using the Aylien API and then allow the user to click through to the full article on the Guardian website.
This single page web app uses pure JavaScript with HTML and CSS and is my first project using APIs in JavaScript.
See more about my [design process](#design-process).


## Setup

Clone the repo on the command line by running

`git clone git@github.com:ewintram/news-summary-challenge.git`


## Usage

To launch the app use a static server e.g.
[http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

Navigate to http://localhost:8080

## Running tests
