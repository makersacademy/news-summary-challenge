# News Summary challenge

## Summary

App that summarizes news articles. It takes headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and displays them on the page, along with a picture icon. Managed to get summary to appear in console but not on page. 

### Technologies

Single page web app.  Written in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Tested using my own [testing framework](https://github.com/imogenmisso/Notes-App/blob/master/lib/test-framework.js).
