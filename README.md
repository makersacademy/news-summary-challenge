News Summary Challenge
=================

A single page front-end news summary application pulling the top headlines from The Guardian API and story summaries via Aylien Text Summary API. No external libraries used (including tests) so full application is in vanilla javascript.

### Quickstart:
#### How to install the code:
Assumes prior global installation of npm http-server
```
$ git clone https://github.com/CLTPayne/news-summary-challenge.git
$ cd news-summary-challenge
$ http-server
```

#### How to use the website:
1. Load the site via ```open index.html```
2. Click on a headline to view a summary of the story at the bottom of the page

#### How to run the tests:
1. ```open specRunner.html```
2. Open the JavaScript console in the browser

### Approach to solving the challenge:
1. Build simple truthy assert clause for use in all tests
2. TDD headline and headline list models for MVC set up
3. TDD headline list view for generating HTML components
4. TDD news controller for rendering HTML on the page
5. Add in single news story model and view for updating page on hash change.

### Status at point of push:
1. Successfully renders page with headlines and images from Guardian API
2. Implemented eventlistener for hashchange which adds summary of news story to bottom of the page upon headline click.

### Description of what code does:
Reproduces the MVC pattern in vanilla JavaScript

### Code Style:
1. Vanilla JavaScript
2. All source code is wrapped in the module pattern
3. All specs are wrapped in IIFEs

### Features:
1. Clickable headlines that display summary of each story

### Intended next steps:
1. Refactor API calls (currently in a script tag of index.html) out to the controller

### Code Example:
Extract from the codebase:
```
(function(exports) {

  function NewsController(headlineList) {
    this.headlineListView = new HeadlineListView(headlineList);
  };

  NewsController.prototype.renderHTML = function() {
    var element = document.getElementById('app')
    element.innerHTML = this.headlineListView.returnHeadlineHTML();
  };

  exports.NewsController = NewsController;

})(this);
```

# Instructions Set by Makers:

* Feel free to use Google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own.
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README.
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution** and send in a pull request.
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning.

## Challenge

As usual please start by forking this repo.

You'll create an app that summarises the news.

### Guidance

Make sure to look at this [guidance](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/further_javascript/frontend_single_page_app_guidance.md)!  It'll help you point yourself in the right direction when you're figuring out how to implement some of the trickier things.

## Project overview

Your app will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

### Technologies

You'll write a single page web app.  You'll write your code in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML.  You won't use Ruby or backend JavaScript.

**And, as is the theme for this week, you won't use any libraries or frameworks!**

But, feel free to use the test framework you wrote during the week!

### Serving your app

You'll use a static web server (e.g. [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) to serve your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.  You'll send requests to an API to get data from the Guardian and to summarise text.

> The API is hosted on an external server that you don't have to worry about.  You only need a static web server.  That's why this type of architecture is called "serverless".

## User Stories

Some of these stories will need decomposing if they seem too large.

```
As a busy politician
I can see all of today's headlines in one place
So I know what the big stories of the day are
```

```
As a busy politician
I can see a relevant picture to illustrate each news article when I browse headlines
So that I have something nice to look at
```

```
As a busy politician
I can click a news headline to see a summary and a photo of the news article
So that I can get an in depth understanding of a very important story
```

```
As a busy politician
I can see click a news article summary title which links to the original article
So I can get a few more details about an important story
```

```
As a busy politician
I can read the site comfortably on my phone
Just in case my laptop breaks
```

```
As a busy politician
I can see whizzy animations in the app
To make my news reading more fun
```

## API

### API authentication

So that this project can focus on the front-end, we've provided an API that you can use to talk to the Guardian API and the Aylien text summarisation API.  This API's only job is to take your request and add an API key.  This way, you don't have to store API keys in your front-end app.

> Why is it bad to store API keys in your front-end?  If we hadn't provided this API for you to use, how would you avoid this?

### API request rate limits and stubbing

The Guardian and Aylien text summarisation APIs are severely rate-limited.

**Please stub your tests so we don't exceed the daily limit.  Otherwise, all requests will be rejected and everyone's apps will stop working!**

### API Overview

The basic idea is to send an `apiRequestUrl` query parameter to the News Summary API.  The value of this parameter is the URL of the request you *would* have made to the Guardian or Aylien API, minus any API credentials.

### Guardian API example

**Please stub your tests to avoid exceeding the API rate limit**

If you wanted to get the content of an article from the Guardian API, this is the cURL request you might make.  Notice how it has a query parameter for `api-key`.

```
curl "http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2014/feb/17/alex-salmond-speech-first-minister-scottish-independence-eu-currency-live?show-fields=body&api-key=SECRET_API_KEY"
```

To make this request via the Makers News Summary API with cURL, you could do something like this:

```
curl "http://news-summary-api.herokuapp.com/guardian?apiRequestUrl=http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2014/feb/17/alex-salmond-speech-first-minister-scottish-independence-eu-currency-live?show-fields=body"
```

Note how the `apiRequestUrl` parameter value is just the request you would have made to the Guardian API, minus `api-key`.

### Aylien text summarisation API example

**Please stub your tests to avoid exceeding the API rate limit**

If you wanted to use the Aylien API to summarise an article by Bret Victor, this is the cURL request you might make.  Notice how it has headers to authenticate with the Aylien API.

```
curl "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/summarize?url=http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/note.html" \
  -H "X-AYLIEN-TextAPI-Application-ID: APPLICATION_ID" \
  -H "X-AYLIEN-TextAPI-Application-Key: SECRET_APPLICATION_KEY"
```

To make this request via the Makers News Summary API with cURL, you could do something like this.

```
curl "http://news-summary-api.herokuapp.com/aylien?apiRequestUrl=https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/summarize?url=http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/note.html"
```

Note how the `apiRequestUrl` parameter is just the request you would have made to the Aylien API.  Notice how you don't have to send authentication headers.
