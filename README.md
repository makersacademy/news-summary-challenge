### Challenges

You'll write a single page web app.  You'll write your code in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML.  You won't use Ruby or backend JavaScript.
**And, as is the theme for this week, you won't use any libraries or frameworks!**
But, feel free to use the test framework you wrote during the week!
