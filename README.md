# News Summary challenge

## Challenge

Create an app that summarises the news.
Your app will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

### My approach

I have created basic one page app, which displays 10 headlines of guardian articles and when you click on title it redirects you to the original article.

Point for improvement: to use suggested API to summarize article and to create a view to see a summary; code in tests needs serious refactoring (DRY).

### Instructions

* clone this repository
* cd repo-name
