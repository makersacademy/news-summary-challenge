# News Summary challenge

* Makers Academy challenge to build a Single Page News App

## Project overview

The app grabs news article information from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  The landing page shows the headlines and images of 10 news articles.  Clicking on a headlines shows the full text of the article.  Clicking on the 'show article summary' button next to an artile will display a summary of this article.  The 'full article view' can be reached from the 'article summary view' and vice versa, and both views allow the user to go back to the initial article list. 

### Technologies

This is written as a single page web app.  The code is written in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML.  It uses no frameworks or libraries. 
It uses the Aylien API to summarise text, and the Guardian API to query news articles.

The app use a static web server ([http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) to serve the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.  Requests are sent to an API to get data from the Guardian and to summarise text.

### Using the app at home

**The app currently uses static data to render the news article views, stored in data.json, to minimise requests to the Guardian API.  If you want to use live data, change 'let url' in 'APIQuery.js'**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/fbl11/news-summary-challenge
$ cd news-summary-challenge
$ npm install
$ node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server -o
```

STATUS
-----
Implements article listing, summary view and full view.

**Notes**

* The entire app is currently untested.
* The app does not have any styling.
* The article summary is currently created by passing the article url to the Aylien API.  I would prefer to use the full article text (which is returned by the Guardian API and which I'm using to display the full article) to create the summary instead of the external link, but have not yet been able to implement.

**TO DO**

- Add tests
- Use body text to create article summaries instead of Guardian url
- Add styling
- Add up-to-date domain model

## User Stories

Some of these stories will need decomposing if they seem too large.
