# News Summary challenge

The Headlines allows the user to see the day's headlines on one page. The single-page JavaScript app pulls news from the Guardian's API. Alongside JavaScript, the programme utilises HTML and CSS for styling.

The creation of The Headlines was test-driven without the use of an existing test framework. Testing was carried out using Marathon, a framework created for this project.
