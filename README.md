# Ame News
Ame News represents the implementation of Makers Academy weekend challenge of making a news basic app by using the Guardian newspaper. The challenge has been set to be written using only pure Javascript, with no frameworks or libraries being allowed.

## Approach
Firstly, I have started researching how to fetch the API, as this has been the first time I worked with requesting resources.
After I was able to console log the news API data, I proceeded to designing the objects I need for the implementation: Article List, Article.

## Setup
- $ git clone https://github.com/gabrielabud/news-summary-challenge
- $ open index.html
- $ ./oh-notify -> to see the tests

### Headlines page

### Article summary page

## User Stories

The following user stories have been implemented:

```
As a busy politician
I can see all of today's headlines in one place
So I know what the big stories of the day are
```

```
As a busy politician
I can click a link to see the original news article
So that I can get an in depth understanding of a very important story
```

```
As a busy politician
I can see a summary of a news article
So I can get a few more details about an important story
```

```
As a busy politician
I can see a picture to illustrate each news article when I browse headlines
So that I have something nice to look at
```

## Further improvements
I had developed the program in a more functional way. If I had more time, I would refactor the code my extracting more objects and implementing more SRP. Furthermore, I should add more tests that focus on behaviour.
