## Task
I have been tasked to create a web app that will grab all the headlines using the Guardian API. Clicking these headlines will then redirect users towards the corresponding articles on the Guardian's website. I will be doing this by coding in frontend Javascript and will be using HTML and CSS to display the website. I will be writing my code with a TDD approach and will be using Jest for testing.

## Instructions
Clone this repository to your desired location using `git clone https://github.com/mcsuGH/news-summary-challenge.git`.\
\
You can then run `npm install` whilst in the main directory in your terminal to install any dependencies and then use the command `jest` to run the tests.\
\
Sign up for an API key from the Guardian.
