# News Summary challenge

## My Approach

I aimed to use this project to further my understanding of JavScript concepts and syntax. I have used a TDD approach for this project and no testing frameworks have been used. I have built a simple testing framework that you can view in the 'spec/assert.js' file.

I have ran out of time and so have had to spike the entirety of my article list view function, and so this has not been tested. If I had more time I would have gone back and re written this using a test driven approach. Some of the user stories below have not been satisfied, and so currently the user can see the headlines on the web app and these contain a hyperlink to the page as opposed to a summary. If I had more time I would have rectified this to keep it inline with the below user stories.
