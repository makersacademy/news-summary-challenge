# News Summary Challenge

A news summary application made for the week 7 end of unit challenge at Makers.

Uses the Guardian API to list out the biggest headlines of the day, and allows you to click on each one to fetch the body of the article.

This is a one page JS web app which uses dynamic HTTP requests.

No frameworks were used to make this app, except for http-server. All the files in /lib/ were created for the challenge.


## To install and run

Prerequisites:
- node
- npm
- http-server

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dan-holmes/news-summary-challenge.git
$ npm install
```

Then navigate to localhost:8080/index.html in your browser.

## To run tests

Navigate to localhost:8080/SpecRunner.html in your browser and view the console.

Please take a moment to check out my home made testing library in /lib!
