## Summary
I found this weekend challenge tricky as I was not comfortable with the weeks learning material yet. I first attempted to use work done previosuly for the Notes app but I quickly got blocked by the fact I wasn't sure how to fetch the news API. In an attempt to progress still I used another student's repo to guide me (gjstirling).

Having perservered with the challenge I ended up learning how to implement CSS files to alter the design of a webpage. I would like to play around with this a bit more as I only scratched the surface of how the sections, colours, sizes and fonts of the html can be changed.
