# News Summary challenge

## About

This is a single page web app that aggregates the news using The Guardian and Aylien text summarisation APIs, all tested through a **custom built testing framework** [Jennifer](https://github.com/domvernon/jennifer.js). Currently, the page will only show the headlines, as asynchronous code was difficult to work with. With more time, the app would be made to work with text summarisation, so when the user clicks a headline, they can see a summary of the article.

What does work well however is that it is an object oriented app that can store some input (in memory) and display content.

## Setup

No third party libraries to install, unless you want to check if I missed any Eslint violations (Air Bnb standard). In that case make sure you have node/npm installed and run `npm install`.

Clone the repository though.

## Instructions

Simply open `index.html` and watch the 'magic' happen. You can click on a healine to be taken to the aritcle on the Guardian website.
