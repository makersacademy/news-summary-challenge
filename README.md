# News Summary challenge

A single-page web app grabs headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and displays them on a page. Users can view the original news article by clicking on the headline's link.

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript - business logic
* HTML, CSS - interface

* APIs: [Guardian newspaper API](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/), [Aylien text summary API](http://docs.aylien.com/docs/summarize)

### Instructions

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Xin00163/news-summary-challenge.git
$ cd news-summary-challenge
$ open index.html
```

### Running the Test Suite
```
$ open SpecRunner.html
```

### Notes
Though this challenge is not completed, I had a good understanding of MVC, XMLHttpRequest objects, and APIs. If given more time, I would like to fix the two failing tests and refactor.
