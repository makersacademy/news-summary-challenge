# News Summary challenge

## Project overview

Your app will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

## How to run

If you don't have it already, you will need to install Node (https://nodejs.org/en/)

$ git clone git@github.com:Alexander-Blair/news-summary-challenge.git  
$ cd news-summary-challenge  
$ npm install  
$ node app.js

### Approach

Two separate controllers - one to handle the Guardian API request for headlines, one to handle the multiple Aylien API requests for summaries of each article. This helped to keep each object manageable.

Aside from this, I included objects to handle each article, its headline, summary etc, and objects to take care of generating HTML for a headline, or an article view.

### Technologies

Frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

## API

### API authentication

So that this project can focus on the front-end, we've provided an API that you can use to talk to the Guardian API and the Aylien text summarisation API.  This API's only job is to take your request and add an API key.  This way, you don't have to store API keys in your front-end app.

### API Overview

The basic idea is to send an `apiRequestUrl` query parameter to the News Summary API.  The value of this parameter is the URL of the request you *would* have made to the Guardian or Aylien API, minus any API credentials.

### Guardian API example

**Please stub your tests to avoid exceeding the API rate limit**

If you wanted to get the content of an article from the Guardian API, this is the cURL request you might make.  Notice how it has a query parameter for `api-key`.

```
curl "http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2014/feb/17/alex-salmond-speech-first-minister-scottish-independence-eu-currency-live?show-fields=body&api-key=SECRET_API_KEY"
```

To make this request via the Makers News Summary API with cURL, you could do something like this:

```
curl "http://news-summary-api.herokuapp.com/guardian?apiRequestUrl=http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2014/feb/17/alex-salmond-speech-first-minister-scottish-independence-eu-currency-live?show-fields=body"
```

Note how the `apiRequestUrl` parameter value is just the request you would have made to the Guardian API, minus `api-key`.

### Alyien text summarisation API example

**Please stub your tests to avoid exceeding the API rate limit**

If you wanted to use the Aylien API to summarise an article by Bret Victor, this is the cURL request you might make.  Notice how it has headers to authenticate with the Aylien API.

```
curl "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/summarize?url=http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/note.html" \
  -H "X-AYLIEN-TextAPI-Application-ID: APPLICATION_ID" \
  -H "X-AYLIEN-TextAPI-Application-Key: SECRET_APPLICATION_KEY"
```

To make this request via the Makers News Summary API with cURL, you could do something like this.

```
curl "http://news-summary-api.herokuapp.com/aylien?apiRequestUrl=https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/summarize?url=http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/note.html"
```

Note how the `apiRequestUrl` parameter is just the request you would have made to the Aylien API.  Notice how you don't have to send authentication headers.
