# News Summary [![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/AlinaGoaga/NewsSummary?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

This is a test driven JavaScript app which uses the [**custom testing framework**](https://github.com/AlinaGoaga/JS_TestingFramework) built in week seven at Makers.

The app takes the headlines from the **Guardian API** and displays them on the page.

Clicking on a headline (or its corresponding picture) will show a summary of the article (this is managed by the **Aylien API**). The summary page has also a return to homepage button for easy navigation.

The user can visit the article's original location and see its contents in full by clicking on the "read the article on the Guardian website" option.

Lastly, the app is **responsive** for easy access on a variety of devices.
