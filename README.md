# News Summary challenge

This is the week 7 weekend challenge from Makers Academy.

## The Task

To create an app that will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

See full instructions on the original repo [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/news-summary-challenge).

As the Makers API credentials were maxed out when I began work on this challenge, I requested an API key from the _Guardian_ directly and used a method devised by my esteemed colleague Paul Martin of hiding my API key. See his commit for this [here](https://github.com/Hives/news-summary-challenge/commit/0cf29a44b54ab235bbe888e574854bceec2a3050).
