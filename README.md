# News Summary challenge

This challenge was to build a single page web app, with no frameworks or testing libraries. The code is written in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

The news summary app uses an API to sent XHR requests to the Guardian in order to retrieve news articles and headlines. It uses a static web server to serve the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.
