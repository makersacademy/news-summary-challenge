# NEW SUMMARY CHALLENGE

This is incomplete and I didn't run any tests, rather I was just playing around with JS and apis.

### To run the app:
- copy 'config_template.js' and rename it 'config.js'
- insert a Guardian api key as directed in 'config.js'
- `open index.html`

Took me a while to figure out how to get going with httpserver, the docs simpy are not clear on this.

Get started:
- check if node and npm are installed `node -v` `npm -v`
- install node and npm if required
- npm install http-server --save
- copy 'config_template.js' and rename it 'config.js'
- insert a Guardian api key as directed in 'config.js'
- open index.html
