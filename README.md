News Summary Challenge
==================

Brief Summary of Approach
-------
I had a significant amount of guidance from Ellie Wem who paired with me on Saturday to walkthrough the content from the week that I had not learned.  This was mostly due to investing my time into building a javascript testing framework from scratch.  As you can see, I did not test drive the development of this website for which I am very much ashamed! I was feeling very overwhelmed at being behind and having missed learning opportunities so approached this with a to do list that Ellie wrote and I continued to add to after she left.  I implemented the summary and photo myself.  I did a lot of exploring in the console which really helped my understanding of how the API was working and what the code I wanted to write was.

Points for development:
* test using jennifer.js framework
* use AJAX for asynchronous code to speed up the user experience.
