Project Learnings:
-----

Through creating this application, I improved my ability to:

* Test-drive a simple Javascript program running in a web browser, using modern JS build tools.
* Use the DOM API to build a web user interface.
* Build a single-page web application fetching and updating remote data using JS.
* Interrogate and manipulate data from API requests.
* Unit test API requests using Jest mocks. 


## Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Create an `apiKey.js`file which exports your API Key
3. Use `npm build` to run the bundler in watch mode.
4. Open the index.html file in your browser
5. Run tests with `npx jest`.

### API authentication
