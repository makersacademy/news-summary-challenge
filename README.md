Have done little for this challenge as have chosen to work on my CV and job stuff this weekend.

Will return to this project in the future though.

I would have created an article model that hand the contents of the article including headline, text body, image and url.

As well as a list model for the articles and list view. Also a controller to render the articles and display them on the homepage as well as single article view page to be able to click on the links. This is what I plan to do in the future.


## Project overview

Your app will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

## User Stories

Some of these stories will need decomposing if they seem too large.
