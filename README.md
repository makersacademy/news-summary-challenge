# News Summary challenge

## Challenge

Create an app that summarises the news.
Your app will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

### My approach

I have created basic one page app, which displays 10 headlines of guardian articles and when you click on title it redirects you to the original article.

Points for improvement: to use suggested API to summarize article and to create a view to see a summary; code in tests needs serious refactoring (DRY).

### Instructions

* clone this repository
* cd repo-name
* npm install http-server
* run server --> node node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server
* go to localhost:8080 in your browser

### Technologies
**And, as is the theme for this week, no use any libraries or frameworks!**

Frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML.  

Code is tested with custom made testing framework written in Javascript.
To see tests passing run index.html file in the browser and inspect a page.
