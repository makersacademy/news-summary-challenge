# News Summary challenge

This is my solution to [this](https://github.com/makersacademy/news-summary-challenge) challenge.  

## How to use  

Use your terminal to navigate to a directory in which you want this to be saved and enter:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AdamusBG/news-summary-challenge.git
$ cd news-summary-challenge
$ npm install http-server
$ npx http-server
```

And then use your browser to navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080.  
To kill the server, click back into the terminal and press control+c.
