# News Summary challenge ðŸ“°

The objective is to create an app that summarises the news. It aims to grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

## Approach

I first structured off the week's challenge to get the foundation setup. Once I did that, I then
started adding in the API and re-edited my code to apply for that. I believe I managed to get halfway
with getting the api data but haven't executed it fully via callbacks.

Will return to this project when I have the time to do so.


## How to Use 
[Although a work in progress, attempt when updated as mostly done.]

Clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/thatdania/news-summary-challenge.git
```
Then change into the directory 
```
cd news-summary-challenge 

```
Make sure you install node and install npm (i.e make sure you have it) 
```
node -v
npm -v
```

Run the following code to see it on the page
```
node server.js 
```

## User Stories (for guidance)

Some of these stories will need decomposing if they seem too large.
