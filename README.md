# News Summary challenge

- The first 10 articles of "The Guardian" API, gets fetched and displayed as Bootstrap cards.
- When clicking on a "Read More" button, a modal opens revealing the full text of the article, a clickable title and a thumbnail.
- The project is responsive.
- Given more time I woul've implemented the Aylien API to summarize and would've made some tests.

## Project overview

Your app will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page. Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

### Technologies

This is a single page web app written in frontend JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap and HTML.

## User Stories

Some of these stories will need decomposing if they seem too large.
