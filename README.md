## How to use

- Click on the ice creams to view a recipe.

## Development

Vanilla was initially built as part of the Makers Academy news app weekend challenge, and used APIs to source stories from The Guardian then generate summaries in Aylien.

This version has been repurposed to present an ice cream recipe when an ice cream is clicked.
