# News Summary challenge

## How to use

- Clone this repo
- Run with http-server, using this guide https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/http_server.md

### Functionality

- Unfortunately this app doesn't have a lot of functionality. It loads the stories that I selected, and when you click on the headline you can see the stories. It's a one page app, but each story doesn't have it's own URL yet. 

## Goals of Feedback

- I think the feedback will be mainly driven by my questions on how to impliment the features that I don't have.

 What I found challenging
 -------

 I found this challenge to be one of the most difficult so far: 
 - I tried for a long time to get my page to grab the headlines from a search of the Guardian website. I was also unclear about whether this was the goal of the challenge or not. In the end it didn't work, so I had to select the articles myself. 
 - Getting the api to work was quite challenging.
- I couldn't extract my code to a controller.

## What I think went well

- I'm really please that I managed to understand what was being returned by the API. I was confused for a long time because it looks like a dictionary. Once I realised it was a string that I could use Json with, things got easier. I'm pleased I worked out how to use json, as well. 
- I've built my confidence a lot this weekend about my research skills. I feel I'm really improving at learning new technologies by myself. 

## What I would do if I had more time

- Get some tests going, as I feel very guilty that I haven't written any! I felt unable to write any as I wasn't at all clear on the technology I was using, and once I'd got some basic functionality going, the weekend was over. I'm also confused as to how to test what I've written.


## What I want to improve on

- Interogating what is being returned when I create an object using a new technology. This is the second time that I've made costly assuptions about an object that proved to be incorrect.
