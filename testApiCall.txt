It was another August Friday night opening for the Bundesliga as champions, another win for Bayern Munich and another goal for the flying Dutchman – and as with every time when he doesn’t start a match, even at the ripe old age of 34, he wore a buzz of indignation around him. So, was he annoyed to be left out? “Yes,” he chuckled, with necessary brevity.</p> <p>Plus ça change, you might think, as neutrals cling to unlikely scraps of hope that there might be a title race worthy of the name over the coming months. If Bayern remain overwhelming favourites, though, there is a sense that they come into this season needing to put a few things right.</p> <p>That Thomas Müller was the central figure in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/24/bayern-munich-hoffenheim-bundesliga-match-report\">the win over Hoffenheim</a> – his opener made him the first player to score the first goal of a Bundesliga season on three separate occasions, before his smart pass set up Robben’s clincher late on – was significant in this context.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/27/carlo-ancelotti-shreds-the-napoli-narrative-with-comeback-win-over-milan\">Carlo Ancelotti shreds the Napoli narrative with comeback win over Milan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The first few days back home weren’t the best of my life,” Müller had told the club’s in-house TV channel in an interview that followed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/28/joachim-low-cannot-survive-germany-world-cup-humilation\">German national team’s early return from the World Cup</a>. His performance on Friday night, bristling with invention in a midfield position that Pep Guardiola had openly suggested he didn’t have the technical quality to succeed in, continued the reaction that he had verbally outlined. “We want to show everyone,” he had continued, “that Bayern and the national team can do better.”</p> <p>Whether purposely or not, Müller had hit the nail on the head. With so many of Bayern’s key players main protagonists in this summer’s shortcomings – Jérôme Boateng, Manuel Neuer, Joshua Kimmich, Mats Hummels, Müller himself – Germany’s failure this summer felt like Bayern’s too. Neuer and Müller also clumsily waded into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/22/mesut-ozil-retires-german-national-team-discrimination\">the Mesut Özil controversy</a> which, as the TV cameras that lingered on the under-pressure DfB president Reinhard Grindel and Germany’s team manager Oliver Bierhoff as the national anthem played before kick-off underlined, threatens to have longer-lasting effects than failure on the pitch out in Russia.</p> <p>Add to this the soreness of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/19/eintracht-frankfurt-beat-bayern-munich-german-cup-final\">the DfB Pokal final loss</a> to new coach Niko Kovac’s Eintracht Frankfurt which ended the last campaign (and boy, were Bayern sore about it) and the thought that the champions swiftly need to turn the page makes its way to the front of the mind. Kovac also has plenty to prove, making a significant step up and not as a choice that inspires unanimous excitement, either.</p> <p>Yet while the new man might not immediately fire the imagination, he might be just the job for right now. A former Bayern player (and 2003 double winner), Kovac understands how this very particular club works, and feels like a safe pair of hands post-Jupp Heynckes. After last week’s laboured Pokal win at fourth-tier Drochtersen/Assel, Uli Hoeness went to great length to underline that his new man was no consolation prize after Heynckes’ exit.</p> <p>Already, Kovac has the confidence to make tough decisions, like leaving Robben and Mats Hummels on the bench, along with James Rodríguez and new boy Leon Goretzka, and like playing Müller in midfield, where he led the dance during a first half in which Julian Nagelsmann’s visitors struggled to stay with Bayern.</p> <p>The primary aim, though, is for the coach to be solid. Süddeutsche Zeitung’s Benedikt Warmbrunn noted that Kovac, a man who likes to be fresh and sharp on the touchline, had submitted to a rather less flattering rain jacket to keep off the persistent Munich drizzle. “The rain jacket was just a minor feature on this Friday evening,” wrote Warmbrunn. “Yet it was a phenomenon that stood for the big picture. It was a pragmatic decision, typical for Bayern under their new coach.</p> <p>That, perhaps, was just what they needed after their summer of turbulence. Bayern managed to battle their way through a rocky second half too, when Nagelsmann’s side fought back strongly and equalised through Adam Szalai. It was, to an extent, home comfort. “They played no futuristic football,” continued Warmbrunn. “They did not intoxicate.”</p> <p>Robben heartily praised Hoffenheim and Nagelsmann (“They have a great coach – you can tell by the way they play football,” the winger said), though the latter was fuming at the award of Bayern’s penalty that eventually, after some VAR examination and a retake, made it 2-1. “I wouldn’t have given that,” Kovac sympathised, following Franck Ribéry’s vault over Havard Nordveit’s challenge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73e7171d11007c23dfec86761a75eee416f890ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73e7171d11007c23dfec86761a75eee416f890ca/0_79_1668_1001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bayern coach Niko Kovac on the touchline against Hoffenheim\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bayern coach Niko Kovac on the touchline against Hoffenheim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthias Schrader/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nagelsmann – who Hoeness said last week was probably “three years from being ready” for the Bayern job, which could be interpreted as a boost for RB Leipzig, his employers from summer 2019 – was certainly not let down by his team, having prepared himself to rub shoulders with the bold and the beautiful in Munich, later telling Bild that he had got his eyebrows shaped and make-up done to look his best on the touchline for the season opener. He wasn’t about to let a rain jacket crease his shirt.</p> <p>For once, there was a boss on the touchline who might have been too showbiz for Bayern, and it wasn’t Kovac. It’s by evolution, not revolution, that Bayern’s main figureheads will put the summer of 2018 behind them.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p><br>• The weekend closed with arguably its biggest fixture, as Borussia Dortmund took on Leipzig in the potential best-of-the-rest face-off. It was an unusual game, with Ralf Rangnick’s side opening the scoring through Jean-Kévin Augustin after 31 seconds and looking by far the more cohesive unit for long spells. “Leipzig were better than we were,” conceded the debutant BVB coach, Lucien Favre, “especially at the beginning.” Yet on the back of some fine goalkeeping by Roman Bürki and ruthlessness in front of goal, Dortmund ran out 4-1 winners. “There are many things to correct,” Favre warned, though Marco Reus’s clinching goal, beautifully laid on by Jadon Sancho, suggests they already have his trademark counterattacking down pat.</p> <p>• Borussia Mönchengladbach were victorious in Saturday’s big game with Bayer Leverkusen. Coach Dieter Hecking’s new 4-3-3 worked a treat as the second half went on, and Fabian Johnson’s goal to seal the game was the team move of the weekend.</p> <p>• Hats off to Hendrik Weydandt who scored 77 seconds into his Bundesliga debut as substitute for Hannover, having spent last season playing for Germania Egestorf/Langreder in the Regionalliga Nord, the fourth tier. It didn’t win all three points, with Theodor Gebre Selassie netting a late Werder Bremen equaliser.</p> <p>• Nikolai Müller had a better first day than last season. Having ruptured his cruciate ligaments celebrating scoring Hamburg’s winner against Augsburg, he opted for a more modest acknowledgement of his opener in new club Eintracht Frankfurt’s 2-0 win at Freiburg.</p> <p>• Those who though the VAR contributed a little too much to the spectacle at the Allianz Arena didn’t see Wolfsburg’s 2-1 win over Schalke. There were two retrospective card changes – Matija Nastasic’s yellow upgraded to a red for the visitors, and home striker Wout Weghorst’s red later swapped for a yellow. Referee Patrick Ittrich was so dizzied by it that he later showed John Anthony Brooks (who scored Wolfsburg’s opener) a red by accident when booking him.</p>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/08a93787b79f4e1cfd1639b44750a3384bdd6618/0_117_3388_2032/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/aug/27/facebook-is-being-eclipsed-by-its-youthful-rival-snapchat","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-27T11:31:00Z","webTitle":"Facebook is being eclipsed by its youthful rival Snapchat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/27/facebook-is-being-eclipsed-by-its-youthful-rival-snapchat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/aug/27/facebook-is-being-eclipsed-by-its-youthful-rival-snapchat","fields":{"body":"<p>Facebook has officially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/16/parents-killed-it-facebook-losing-teenage-users\">lost its cool</a>.

Seldom before have those species of comedy been cross-bred – but then not all comics have a story to tell as eye-opening as Olga Koch’s. She is the daughter of a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Koch\"> provincial mayor in the USSR, briefly turned deputy PM of Boris Yeltsin’s Russia</a>. Alfred Koch cooked up the “voucher privatisation” scheme that channelled Soviet state assets into the hands of the oligarchs. As Olga says, that’s a hell of dad fact for a teenage daughter to have in reserve when she needs to win a family argument.</p> <p>Her debut Edinburgh show (she was shortlisted for best newcomer) tells her parents’ story in flashback from the time, four years ago, that her dad went alarmingly awol from his Moscow apartment. It’s part storytelling, part family album, and part <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...on_Television\">Clive James on TV </a>mockery of Russian advertising. I found those latter sections a little condescending. But given what her dad has suffered, and continues to suffer, at Russia’s hands, you can’t blame Koch – Russian-born, American-educated – for taking potshots in the other direction.</p> <p>Her story ends with Olga’s visit to a democracy museum in Yekaterinburg, when she starts to see dad’s experiences through a new lens – cueing a climactic homily about truth, lies and the need to testify. The show is often more fascinating than funny, and is overdependent for laughs on found footage. It leaves you with little idea of what kind of comedian Koch will become. But she’s a spirited and confident host, and her story – of a normal family caught up in, then tossed out of Russian history – is remarkable.</p> <p>• Read all our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2018+tone/reviews\">Edinburgh festival reviews</a>.</p> <p></p>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/836cb40eac228e31c986e90e5d1c8214d5265fd9/0_861_5456_3274/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/aug/27/facebook-removes-accounts-myanmar-military-un-report-genocide-rohingya","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-27T11:14:35Z","webTitle":"Facebook removes accounts associated with Myanmar military","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/27/facebook-removes-accounts-myanmar-military-un-report-genocide-rohingya","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/aug/27/facebook-removes-accounts-myanmar-military-un-report-genocide-rohingya","fields":{"body":"<p>Facebook has removed 18 accounts and 52 pages associated with the Myanmar military, including the page of its commander-in-chief, after <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/27/myanmars-military-accused-of-genocide-by-damning-un-report\">a UN report </a>accused the armed forces of genocide and war crimes.</p> <p>In an unusually prompt move, the pages and accounts of the Mynamar military, known as the Tatmadaw, were deleted just minutes after the UN fact-finding mission released its damning report. </p> <p>Facebook, which is a highly popular source of information in Myanmar, has come under criticism for giving a platform to vitriolic posts aimed at stirring up and spreading hatred against the minority Muslim Rohingya population.

While they assessed the state of the nation, I had a memorable few days being fed by terrifically hospitable locals keen to show off their delicious cuisine. In particular, I loved the sweet-sour salads studded with herbs, grains, walnuts and fruit. This is a high-summer homage to the country.</p> <h2><strong>Freekeh salad with nectarine</strong>,<strong> parsley</strong>,<strong> cucumber</strong>,<strong> walnuts and golden halloumi</strong></h2> <p>This works beautifully as part of a meze of dishes, with people digging in using the little gem as scoops.</p> <p>Prep <strong>20 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>40 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>4-6</strong></p> <p><strong>150g freekeh</strong>, rinsed in several changes of water<br><strong>1 bunch parsley</strong><br><strong>½ bunch mint</strong>,<strong> </strong>leaves<strong> </strong>picked<br><strong>4 spring onions</strong><br><strong>3 nectarines</strong>,<strong> </strong>stoned<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong><br tabindex=\"-1\"><strong tabindex=\"-1\">½ cucumber</strong><br tabindex=\"-1\"><strong tabindex=\"-1\">150g baby tomatoes</strong>,<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>quartered<br tabindex=\"-1\"><strong tabindex=\"-1\">1 big handful walnuts</strong><br tabindex=\"-1\"><strong tabindex=\"-1\">3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong><br tabindex=\"-1\"><strong tabindex=\"-1\">Juice of 2 lemons</strong><br tabindex=\"-1\"><strong tabindex=\"-1\">1 pinch ground cumin</strong><br tabindex=\"-1\"><strong tabindex=\"-1\">Salt and black pepper</strong><br tabindex=\"-1\"><strong tabindex=\"-1\">2 little gem lettuce</strong>,<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>leaves separated <br tabindex=\"-1\"><strong>250g halloumi</strong>,<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>drained,<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>cut into 5mm slices</p> <p>Bring a pan of water to a boil and cook the freekeh for 30 minutes, until tender. Meanwhile, prepare the other ingredients.</p> <p>Finely chop the parsley, mint and spring onions and transfer to a large bowl. Cut the nectarines into wedges, then cut the cucumber in half lengthways and, using a teaspoon, scoop out and discard the seeds. Roughly dice into 1-2cm pieces. Roughly chop the walnuts to match and add them all to the bowl.</p> <p>Once the freekeh is cooked, drain and rinse under cold water to cool. Add to the salad bowl along with two tablespoons of oil, the lemon juice, cumin and plenty of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Toss well and transfer to a large platter (or individual plates, if you prefer). Scatter the little gem leaves around the edge.</p> <p>To cook the halloumi, warm up a medium-sized frying pan and, when hot, add the remaining oil. Pat each slice of halloumi dry with kitchen paper and add to the hot oil, turning over when golden – about a minute. When cooked, transfer to the top of the salad and serve at once.</p> <h2><strong>And for the rest of the week</strong></h2> <p>When the last of the nectarines are finished, use pomegranates, blackberries or dried apricots instead. I love this salad with grilled lamb, fish or burgers. Grill the halloumi over the barbecue instead as part of a delicious al fresco feast.</p>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/401374004cf087d1dc0ec3e9e0526140290be813/569_701_6232_3740/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"food/2018/aug/27/mezze-maniche-summer-pasta-recipe-rachel-roddy","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-27T11:00:39Z","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s summer veg pasta | A Kitchen in Rome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/aug/27/mezze-maniche-summer-pasta-recipe-rachel-roddy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2018/aug/27/mezze-maniche-summer-pasta-recipe-rachel-roddy","fields":{"body":"<p>One of my preferred shapes of pasta is <a href=\"https://www.pastamancini.com/en/pasta/mezze-maniche\"><em>mezze maniche</em></a> – literally half or short sleeves. I still have to concentrate when I say it though – med-zay man-e-kay – which, typed here, seems as much a name for a rapper as a dried pasta shape. Half the length of another favourite – tubular, ridged rigatoni – the short sleeves of mezze maniche, with their five-pence diameter, are just the thing for catching and hiding chunks: a cube of pancetta, a tip of asparagus, a bit of broccoli floret, a chunk of fried aubergine.</p> <p>It is chunks of aubergine, also courgette, red pepper and mozzarella, hiding for this week’s recipe: <em>pasta di mezz’estate</em>, or midsummer pasta. It could just as easily be called middle-of-the-summer-holidays, late August or early September pasta, given the summer we have all shared and the subsequent abundance of summer vegetables that looks set to roll on.</p> <p>In the introduction to the recipe in their brilliant book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/sapori-del-Mariano-Pane-Rita/dp/8890199970\">Sapori del Sud</a>, Rita and Mariano Pane describe pasta di mezz’estate as “a stupendous palette of Caravaggio’s colours”, which sounds poncy when I write it, but just right in their words. Rita is right: they are Caravaggio’s colours – or maybe Prince’s – a purple two-piece, white ruffed shirt and a raspberry beret. It is a recipe from Campania, so unsurprisingly the vegetables – a large aubergine, red pepper and a couple of courgettes – are diced and fried until golden in a good inch of olive oil. Incidentally, this means they absorb less oil than a shallow fry. It is this immersion in olive oil that gives the vegetables a rich, almost velvety texture and flavour – a defining one in traditional southern Italian food.</p> <p>I take an almost perverse pleasure in frying when the weather is hot, in the layers of heat and stream of sweat, a habit possibly begun when we fried an egg on the bonnet of Dad’s Rover 100 in 1989. Alternatively, you could roast the diced vegetables in the oven; just be generous with the oil and salt. The parmesan acts much the same way as with tagliatelle and rich bolognese sauce, a sort of culinary glue, melting and melding everything together.</p> <p>The idea of there being pasta shape/sauce rules or official combinations is mismatched with the anarchic joy of food, especially if it is used as a sort of one-upmanship. But there is tradition – pairings that work or have been repeated so often they have taken root: a tangle of spaghetti with clams, corkscrew twists of <em>trofie</em> for pesto, a tube of macaroni, rigatoni or mezze maniche for concealing pieces of aubergine and mozzarella. There is also what you like and have in the cupboard.</p> <p>Whatever pasta you use, pasta di mezz’estate with its glistening vegetables, tomato sheen, melting mozzarella, all united by parmesan and reeking of basil, is a gorgeous, generous dish for a crowd, especially on a warm day, when sunny flavours are called for – salad/watermelon/granita and other icy jolts can come after.</p> <h2>Pasta di mezz’estate – midsummer pasta</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55840b5fccbc0ba976e2b5b7f57b566c6ab2d46b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55840b5fccbc0ba976e2b5b7f57b566c6ab2d46b/0_0_4000_5418/738.jpg\" alt=\"Mezze maniche with chunks of aubergine, courgette, red pepper and mozzarella.\" width=\"738\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mezze maniche with chunks of aubergine, courgette, red pepper and mozzarella.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Roddy for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1 large aubergine<br></strong><strong>1 red pepper<br></strong><strong>2 courgettes<br></strong><strong>Olive or vegetable oil</strong>, for frying<br><strong>2 large ripe tomatoes<br></strong><strong>4 tbsp olive oil<br></strong><strong>1 garlic clove</strong>, peeled and crushed<br><strong>100g parmesan</strong>, grated<br><strong>100g mozzarella</strong>, diced<br><strong>Ripped leaves from 1 big sprig of basil<br></strong><strong>500g pasta</strong>: penne, mezze maniche, fusilli</p> <p>Bring a large pan of water to a boil for the pasta.

He had served as Aimee Challenor’s election agent when she stood in the 2017 general election and in the local elections in May this year – after his arrest.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://aimeechallenor.uk/statements.html\">a statement announcing</a> her withdrawal from the contest Challenor, 20, said she was horrified and saddened by her father’s crimes, and only learned the full details of them very recently, despite living at the family home.</p> <p>“That might be hard for you to understand, or to believe, but it is the truth,” she said. “I was taken into care a few years ago and have also lived in independent supported housing. There were sustained periods where I did not live in the family home.”</p> <p>Challenor added: “Yes, he was my election agent. This was one of a number of ways I was seeking to reconcile my relationship with my father after coming out of care. On reflection, I can understand that it was unacceptable for me to appoint my dad as my election agent when he had been arrested.”</p> <p>Challenor joined the Greens in 2015, and became the party’s equalities spokeswoman a year later, with a particular focus on LGBT issues – she is a trans woman.</p> <p>In a statement <a href=\"https://kualo.greenparty.org.uk/statements/\">the Greens said</a> the party did not know anything about the allegations against David Challenor before he was sentenced.</p> <p>It added: “There is no place for this abhorrent criminal behaviour in the Green party. Mr Challenor is no longer a member, having had his membership removed with immediate effect.”</p> <p>The Green party, which reselects its top lineup every two years, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/02/greens-announce-three-sets-of-contenders-for-uk-leadership-contest\">currently choosing replacements</a> for the leadership team of Caroline Lucas, the party’s sole MP, and Jonathan Bartley.</p> <p>With Lucas opting to step back from the leadership, Bartley is standing on a joint ticket with Siân Berry, a councillor in Camden, north London, and a member of the London assembly. They are seen as the favourites in the race.</p> <p>Five candidates stood for deputy leader, among them Challenor and Amelia Womack, who has filled the role for four years. Party members have the month of August to vote, with the results to be announced in the autumn.</p>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ed18bdc0f4bbde54aab3b547ea6f2b948333b75/0_557_5342_3205/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
