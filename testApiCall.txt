Former senator Nick Xenophon and his former staffer, now Centre Alliance senator, Rex Patrick, spent two years trying to obtain the documents. Philip Morris had taken its case to the permanent court of arbitration in 2012, using a clause in a 1993 Hong Kong-Australia trade deal to sue the Australian government. </p> <p>Patrick said he was blown away by the “mammoth cost” to taxpayers of the legal fight. “This is exactly why Australia must stop signing up to free trade agreements with these insidious ISDS provisions in them,” he said. “I accept the government had to defend the matter, but if we hadn’t signed up to the Hong Kong agreement with ISDS provisions in it then there would not have been a tribunal hearing. Imagine what health outcomes could have been achieved with that $39m.”</p> <p><strong>Latin America’s second-largest economy appeared poised to elect a silver-haired, baseball-loving leftist as its next president</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/mexico-election-amlo-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador\">as 89 million Mexicans headed to the polls on Sunday.</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/andres-manuel-lopez-obrador\">Andrés Manuel López Obrador</a>, the 64-year-old leader of the Morena party, has cast the vote as an epoch-making opportunity to radically transform Mexico by electing a leader who will rid the country of corruption and rule for the 53 million Mexicans still stuck in poverty. Amlo has tried – and failed – to become Mexico’s president twice before, in 2006 and 2012, but his decision to make the fight against corruption the bedrock of his third presidential campaign appears to have paid off, with re-ballot polls suggesting the former Mexico City mayor would trounce rivals. </p> <p><strong>Western Australia’s Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, has accused his federal counterpart of making a racially-charged jibe. </strong>According to Wyatt<strong>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jul/02/wa-minister-says-scullion-unsuitable-to-resolve-remote-indigenous-housing-dispute\"> <br></a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jul/02/wa-minister-says-scullion-unsuitable-to-resolve-remote-indigenous-housing-dispute\">Nigel Scullion is “unsuitable”</a> to resolve a dispute over funding for housing in remote Indigenous communities, after he used a racially charged jibe in a press release, which was headlined “Little Wyatt lies”. “I’ve spent a lot of my life having to deal with the slings and arrows of being an Aboriginal person,” Wyatt said. “Nigel Scullion is just the latest in that ... he’s clearly unsuitable to try to resolve this issue and I am surprised and disappointed that he would resort to such rhetoric.” WA has been at odds with the federal government since December over its decision not to renew the 10-year $5.4bn National Partnership Agreement on Remote Housing (NPARH).</p> <p><strong>Australia’s high wholesale electricity prices are the “new normal” and politicians need to be honest with voters about it,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jul/01/australias-high-electricity-prices-the-new-normal-report-says\">a report by the Grattan Institute thinktank says</a>.

The disruptions then often materially affect outcomes – governments change course, drop ambitious ideas, shape shift to try to avoid an unmanageable stakeholder backlash.”</p> <p><strong>For years the music industry has argued that YouTube exploits the lack of legal protection around music videos being viewed on its service</strong>, to pay minimal amounts to artists and labels, with Taylor Swift leading the charge to get a better share of revenues in the age of the digital music giants. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/01/were-righting-a-wrong-say-the-artists-taking-on-youtube\">The stoush is coming to a head this week</a> in a crucial vote in Brussels, that could force YouTube to pay billions of dollars in fees to popular artists such as Swift, Ed Sheeran and Katy Perry. </p> <p><strong>When award-winning Australian children’s author Lorraine Marwood was diagnosed with cancer</strong>, it upended her world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/02/lord-will-i-die-how-writing-a-book-for-children-helped-me-cope-with-cancer\">but ultimately gave her a new perspective on life</a>. During a year dominated by chemo and radiation treatments she wrote just one book, Leave Taking, aimed at children dealing with death and grief. “Why did I write about grief?” writes Marwood. “Because grief is a tangible part of life; because being a child or an adult does not give you immunity from its crippling effects.”</p> <h2>What’s he done now?</h2> <p><strong>Donald Trump has again urged America to ditch the law when it comes to returning illegal immigants to their home country</strong>, his second tweet in a week to encourage anarchy. “When people come into our Country illegally, we must IMMEDIATELY escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering.

Blimey!</a> </strong>What a World Cup this is! Spain are out on penalties! The hosts march on! Anyway, you’re probably all in shock, like I am, but I’ll carry on with a preamble for this match now. </p> <p><strong>I know it’s not news but Croatia have been brilliant to watch in Russia! </strong>While many of the bigger nations have stumbled around like sleepy giants looking for their glasses and a bit of form, Croatia have just clicked. They’re playing with a rhythm and understanding that makes them seem like a well-grooved club side rather than an international one. In that regard another smaller nation with eyes on the prize, Uruguay, are similar but Croatia have greater creativity. Their midfield of Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic and Marcelo Brozovic is overflowing with ideas and energy. They’re as good as any at the tournament. They also have aggressive attackers. Ivan Perisic and Ante Rebic are wide-eyed rabid forwards who look angry in and out of possession. They are a frightening prospect for full-backs. While Mario Mandzukic’s muscle up top helps give the team shape.</p> <p><strong>So, all this spells trouble for Denmark doesn’t it?</strong> Well, probably. The Danes haven’t impressed in the group stage. They were lucky to beat Peru, prosaic in a 1-1 draw with Australia and were booed off after stinking the place out in a goalless draw with France. Still, they are unbeaten in 18 games and will not be easy to get behind. The Danish public would rather their Norwegian coach, Åge Hareide, take the handbrake off now they’re playing knockout football. The Denmark midfielder Thomas Delaney has hinted that they may play a little more expressively: “We’re not going to lose 5-0 by trying to play tiki-taka football,” he said. “But people shouldn’t get used to seeing us play like we did against France. It’s seldom that we play like this, and the game against Croatia will be a very different spectacle.” </p> <p><strong>If this game is indeed to be World Cup eye-candy Denmark will have to find a way to afford Christian Eriksen a little more freedom.</strong> The Tottenham midfielder has not been able to influence games as he can but without his ingenuity and goal-threat Denmark have very little to offer. It will be interesting to see how he performs up against the creator he replaced at Spurs. Modric has been inventive, buzzy and brilliant so far. The Croatia captain has also snapped into tackles and won back possession like a real leader. Eriksen will need to show similar dynamism and have a game for the ages to inspire this Denmark team to do what they have not been able to since 1998 and reach a World Cup quarter-final.

And Romesh is clearly (certainly more believably than the fear thing) shocked by some of the things he sees. But he manages not to be hand-wringingly worthy about it. I like the way he is with people – not all overly polite because they’re poor and foreign, but just the same as he is with everyone else, deadpan – and if that sometimes leads to misunderstandings and awkwardness, well that is all right. It is – he is – very funny. And he gets a nice thing going with Jeremy – teasing, warm, genuine, that one I do believe. It is not my favourite TV genre, the celebrity travelogue, but if I have to go somewhere with someone, then I don’t mind going with Ranganathan.</p> <p>He does go to the Iron Market, which has been badly damaged in a fire (Haiti really doesn’t get any luck, does it?) since it was rebuilt after being completely destroyed in the earthquake. He gets a load of stuff: a small chair, seven brightly coloured scarves, good-luck shampoo, rum, black fish, etc, that he needs for the inevitable voodoo ceremony. Which takes place away from town at what looks like a lovely place by the sea. Obviously, the ceremony is absolutely terrifying … Is it really, Romesh? He is honest about Haiti as a tourist destination at least. It might not be for everyone. That sounds about right.</p> <p>My wooden figures? Well, they must have had something to do with voodoo, because I did what we do with unwanted stuff in my area; I put them out on the pavement in the hope that someone would take them away. And someone did, since when things have gone relatively well.

In the win over Serbia, comfortably Brazil’s best performance of the group stage, Neymar operated so obediently that it almost seemed appropriate to reach out and ask whether he was sickening for something. “His average performance exceeds his teammates’ performances … but this figure is still not high enough for Neymar,” Tite said, pointing out that he needed to play more games before his recovery from a metatarsal fracture was complete.</p> <p>Brazil have got by in the meantime, Philippe Coutinho becoming the tournament’s most beguiling No&#xa0;10 and Paulinho among others to step up, and if Tite is given to repetition he would be happy for his team to exhibit a similar&#xa0;trait.</p> <p>“There will be tweaks but overall an expectation that our team continues to play as in the last match,” he said of the approach against Mexico, who should be beaten if Brazil can raise things a notch above that but have already, in defeating Germany, shown how to punish underperformers.</p> <p>The only notable absentee will be Marcelo, who departed early against Serbia with a back spasm and will not be risked. Mahseredjian and Tite described, between them, the process for ruling on the left-back’s fitness in minute detail but the gist was that the coach did not feel he could play a full game, particularly in heat that is likely to exceed 34C.</p> <p>The expectation had, after the first set of fixtures in a competition that has given short shrift to confident predictions, been that Germany would provide Brazil’s opposition in Samara. “Germany belongs to the past, you cannot revert to the history,” Thiago said in response to that observation; at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/08/germany-brazil-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">the shadow of Belo Horizonte</a> will not be looming now and Brazil can concentrate upon more gettable foes.</p> <p>Mexico intend to give them a game and their manager, Juan Carlos Osorio, said he will not break from his model of fielding five attacking players. “We will try to keep possession of the ball and I believe we can be better at it,” he said. “Our intention is not to stay behind the ball all the time. We don’t want to stay very deep; they are very good in the last third and always score.”</p> <p>When it clicks for Mexico they crackle, fizz and thrill; no rival has yet produced a counterattacking performance to emulate that of Hirving Lozano, Carlos Vela, Miguel Layún and Javier Hernández against Germany.</p> <p>They are rarely clinical enough though and, as Sweden showed to devastating effect two games later, have a major wobble in them when pressed physically.</p> <p>If Brazil are pleased to be without psychological baggage then Mexico are dogged by constant reminders of six consecutive last-16 exits; their Olympic side did beat Monday’s opponents in the London 2012 final but at senior level they have not scored against them in three meetings since.</p> <p>“Football always gives you an opportunity to win,” Osorio said, pointing out that the mould for underdog stories has been well cast in Russia.</p> <p>If Mexico can block out the noise they may run Brazil close; for Tite’s pack of wolves, though, negotiating their way through the pandemonium their presence brings to a major tournament should be second nature.</p>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/74ec7401611aae31b653f3a7ce81a94a6ede059a/31_19_3535_2121/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jul/01/croatia-denmark-world-cup-last-16-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-01T20:53:31Z","webTitle":"Croatia send Denmark out of World Cup after Subasic heroics in shootout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/01/croatia-denmark-world-cup-last-16-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jul/01/croatia-denmark-world-cup-last-16-match-report","fields":{"body":"<p> There are some matches in which the spectre of penalties begins to loom with indecent haste.

He rounded Kasper Schmeichel and was brought down by the chasing Mathias Jørgensen. Penalty. Modric took it but his composure deserted him. The kick was too close to Kasper Schmeichel and he pulled off the save. And so the match proceeded to the full version, the fate of these nations coming down to the time-honoured test of nerve.</p> <p>Croatia passed it, just about, after a hit-and-miss shoot-out – which neatly reflected what had gone before. After two misses apiece, the Denmark substitute, Nicolai Jørgensen strode forward and saw his kick saved by Danijel Subasic. Ivan Rakitic had one to win it and he made no mistake. It is Croatia who advance to a quarter-final against Russia in Sochi on Saturday. Modric would score in the shoot-out. His blushes were saved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c75504e01a8f04e269978878d0cce0f60e24a4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c75504e01a8f04e269978878d0cce0f60e24a4c/0_549_3066_1840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luka Modric\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luka Modric, left, and goalkeeper Danijel Subasic celebrate after Croatia’s victorious penalty shootout.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Bozoglu/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The weird thing was that the game had exploded into life at the outset, with the goals coming with the first two moves. Only once previously at a World Cup had both teams scored inside four minutes – the group tie between Argentina and Nigeria in 2014.</p> <p>What followed was the slow death of a spectacle. The goals were undercut by comedy defending but there would be little to smile about for the remaining 116 minutes.</p> <p>Croatia had entered as arguably the team of the group phase. Everything had gone serenely for them and the thought did occur as to how they might react to a setback. The question was duly posed inside the opening minute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"World Cup Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>World Cup Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Denmark swapped their left-backs, with Jonas Knudsen coming in for Jens Stryger Larsen, and the new man brought the weapon of his long throw. From the first one, launched from the right touchline, a gaggle of defenders jumped but nobody connected and the ball broke for Thomas Delaney.</p> <p>The midfielder’s control was instant and he made a nice move and pass for Mathias Jørgensen, who saw the shooting chance open up. He went for it, jabbing the effort low, and what followed seemed to happen in slow motion.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/01/spain-russia-world-cup-last-16-match-report\">Russia eliminate Spain from World Cup in last-16 penalty shootout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Domagoj Vida threw himself into a block but he did not make contact and the goalkeeper, Danijel Subasic, was slow to get down. He got a hand to the ball but he could not prevent it from trickling inside the near post. It was a horribly soft concession and Subasic will not enjoy watching the replays.</p> <p>Croatia’s response was immediate and this time it was the Danes who could curse their defending. Ante Rebic was afforded too much space on the right and his short pass inside released Sime Vrsaljko, who banged over the cross. It did not look threatening but Henrik Dalsgaard’s clearance was panicked, it hit the covering Andreas Christensen in the face and ricocheted to Mario Mandzukic, who swivelled and shot inside the near post. What a mess. What a start.</p> <p>The remainder of the game felt like a reaction to the initial chaos. Neither team had previously conceded in open play at the tournament; they were not exactly disposed to such openness, and they sought to reimpose order. Caution held sway and it became an awfully tough watch.</p> <p>Croatia tried to get on to the front foot in the first half, with Modric and Ivan Rakitic playing as No 8s. They had openings but on each occasion, the final action was missing. Rakitic and Rebic forced Kasper Schmeichel into a double save before Ivan Perisic fired the rebound high; Dejan Lovren glanced wide from a Modric free-kick – a good chance – and Rakitic ran on to a cutback only to shoot tamely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e6a79f53b88d3a35aba34b06a4a1bb0cef50655\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e6a79f53b88d3a35aba34b06a4a1bb0cef50655/0_27_2603_1562/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Eriksen is consoled by his captain, Simon Kjaer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christian Eriksen is consoled by his captain, Simon Kjaer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Åge Hareide had tweaked his lineup but the creative burden still rested with Christian Eriksen. Almost everything in open play went through him. He flickered in the first half, seeing one effort blocked and playing in Martin Braithwaite, who shot straight at Subasic from a tight angle. There was also the moment when Eriksen floated a cross towards the back post and watched it drift against the angle of the upright. Subasic was relieved.</p> <p>There were times when Eriksen pushed so high that he looked like a second striker. His stamina is the stuff of legend and the idea was that he could lead the press with the striker, Andreas Cornelius, who would be replaced by Nicolai Jørgensen.</p> <p>It was tight and subdued; the emphasis on tactics rather than instinct and free rein. The locals in the crowd amused themselves with chants of Ros-Si-Ya. They were still giddy from their team’s penalty shootout win over Spain in the earlier kick-off and they were checking out what their quarter-final opponents had to offer. On this evidence, it was not a lot.</p> <p>The entertainment value was low; the second half and extra-time featured little more than hopeful shooting from distance and the Modric penalty. It would need the full shoot-out to separate them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2018/06/world-cup-player-ratings/embed/wrappers/3110090.html\" data-alt=\"Croatia-Denmark ratings\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2018/06/world-cup-player-ratings/embed/wrappers/3110090.html\">Croatia-Denmark ratings</a> <figcaption>Croatia-Denmark ratings</figcaption> </figure>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5f3e1f0983326cf457803c974c8e184efc1c6ad/0_4_2111_1267/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jul/01/democrats-ocasio-cortez-tammy-duckworth-midwest","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-01T20:38:59Z","webTitle":"Ocasio-Cortez politics will not win in Midwest, says Duckworth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/01/democrats-ocasio-cortez-tammy-duckworth-midwest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jul/01/democrats-ocasio-cortez-tammy-duckworth-midwest","fields":{"body":"<p>As Democrats calibrate their political messaging in advance of the November midterm elections, Senator Tammy Duckworth cautioned her party not to become too starry-eyed about the success in New York of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who won an upset primary victory this week. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/01/trump-taunts-democrats-over-calls-to-abolish-ice\">Trump taunts Democrats over calls to abolish Ice: 'They'll never win another election'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Ocasio-Cortez’s platform of Medicare for all and free college tuition might work in New York’s 14th congressional district, said Duckworth, the junior senator from Illinois, her brand of Democratic socialism would not work in the Midwest. </p> <p>“I think that you can’t win the White House without the Midwest,” Duckworth told CNN’s State of the Union. “And I don’t think that you can go too far to the left and still win the Midwest.</p> <p>“Coming from a Midwestern state, I think you need to be able to talk to the industrial Midwest.

Here’s a brief rundown of the major stories heading into the free-agency frenzy.<br></p> <p><strong>LeBron declines player option with the Cavaliers. </strong>The best player in the game declined his $35.6m player option with Cleveland, setting up the possibility that he signs with the Lakers. By not opting into the final year of his deal, Houston appears to be out of the race due to its lack of cap room, but we’ve learned in the past to never count out Rockets general manager Daryl Morey. And don’t rule out a return to Cleveland as well. The Cavs can offer LeBron a five-year deal, something no other team can do.</p> <p><strong>Paul George also declines player option.</strong> The stars are starting to align and they’re pointing toward the La La Land. George is on for a four-year max contract that will pay him almost double the $20.7m he could have earned in the final year of his deal with the Thunder. Like LeBron, a return to OKC cannot be ruled out, especially with reports of how fond George is with Oklahoma. Sam Presti and the Thunder have gone all in on PG13, and it will be a tense time waiting to see if they’ll be rejected again after Kevin Durant bolted for the Warriors two years ago.</p> <p><strong>Spurs talking with the Lakers about Kawhi. </strong>Perhaps one of the most bizarre stories could come to a close in the next 24 hours as the Lakers have reportedly offered the Spurs a “monster deal” for superstar Kawhi Leonard. We may have to wait and see where LeBron and George land before we have a final decision on Kawhi.</p> </div>   </div>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/191b818a4971ed285a07b5ac97cbf2afadab6821/0_246_5568_3341/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2018/jul/01/starwatch-hercules-visible-in-summer-trip-through-south-west","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-01T20:30:49Z","webTitle":"Starwatch: Hercules visible in summer trip through south-west","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jul/01/starwatch-hercules-visible-in-summer-trip-through-south-west","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jul/01/starwatch-hercules-visible-in-summer-trip-through-south-west","fields":{"body":"<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/07/archive-zip/giv-3902kxcqlcuqKRZe/\" data-alt=\"Midnight on 2 July 2018\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/07/archive-zip/giv-3902kxcqlcuqKRZe/\">Midnight on 2 July 2018</a> <figcaption>Midnight on 2 July 2018</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Track the constellation Hercules as it wheels highs across the summer sky. Although not bright, it has a distinctive shape and can be easily picked out with a little effort. </p> <p>The chart shows Hercules at midnight on 2 July, high in the south-western sky. To identify it, locate two bright stars: orange <a href=\"https://www.space.com/22842-arcturus.html\">Arcturus</a> in Boötes and, much higher, blue-white <a href=\"http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/vega-brilliant-blue-white-is-third-brightest-star\">Vega</a> in Lyra. Look from one to the other and your line of sight passes through the body of Hercules, marked by four fainter stars. This off-kilter square is known as the keystone. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/02/hubble-space-telescope-captures-image-of-most-distant-star-ever-seen\">Hubble space telescope captures image of most distant star ever seen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A great star cluster is visible partway between two of the stars in the keystone.
