Frankly, it is a bad move. If Nick was unable to force a better deal in coalition out of David Cameron and the Conservatives, how is he going to transform the inherent inevitability of the insensitivity of the vast Facebook machine? It is far too large and bureaucratic to be capable of any worthwhile measure of change.</p> <p>It is also a badly mistimed move. Nick has always been one of the best proponents of the case for a united Europe and, at precisely the time in our history when every such voice is needed to continue the momentum for rescuing Britain and the EU from a disastrous Brexit, he is abandoning the cause. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouths of his friends and colleagues who value loyalty and commitment to the most important cause of the past 70 years.<br><strong>Michael Meadowcroft</strong><br><em>Leeds</em></p> <p>• Reading Nick Clegg’s article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/19/nick-clegg-facebook-politics-tech\" title=\"\">I’m joining Facebook to help tech to be a force for good</a>, 20 October) I looked in vain for any mention of Facebook’s glaring refusal to pay its fair share of UK taxes. The greatest good that tech could achieve would be Facebook paying these taxes as its contribution to the common good. In the UK, Facebook paid just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/04/facebook-uk-corporation-tax-profit\" title=\"\">£5m in tax on revenues of £842m</a>.</p> <p>Sadly, it’s no surprise that Mr Clegg fails to raise this issue in his article. He has a poor track record when standing up to power: he is responsible for propping up the Tories’ ideological, small-state austerity programme from 2010 to 2015, and the incalculable harm that has done to the wellbeing of our country (evidenced by gross inequality, rising crime, increasing mental ill-health and, indeed, the Brexit vote). I have no expectations that he will find sufficient character to speak truth to power in the case of Mr Zuckerberg and his taxes. <br><strong>Professor Mark Doel</strong><br><em>Sheffield </em></p> <p>• I must admit I was surprised to read of Nick Clegg’s appointment as Facebook’s vice-president of global affairs and communications and that in the New Year we will lose from our beleaguered shores, a committed and vocal remainer.</p> <p>But I think this is a canny decision by Mark Zuckerberg because for what it is worth, I feel that Clegg has been subjected to unnecessary vilification from the press and his former Conservative associates. Contrary to received wisdom that the Coalition years were a cop-out, I look back at a certain halcyon period where he and his associates ameliorated the more divisive policies from their partners and it led to a period of a pragmatic stability than what has followed. I sincerely hope and believe that he will be a force for good in his new role and bring some much-needed sanity to social media because it has certainly morphed into a sometimes cruel and crass entity. What is wrong in our country today is that politicians never escape their legacies and his is the spectre of tuition fees and that appears to cloud every subsequent action. That in my opinion is wrong and counter productive, and we have now lost a dedicated man who maybe didn’t get it right all the time but did exude a sincerity that is sadly and disastrously lacking in many of our politicians who appear to have their own ulterior motivation, contrary to the ultimate good of the country.<br><strong>Judith </strong><strong>Daniels</strong><br><em>Cobholm, </em><em>Norfolk </em></p> <p>• I hope that, as vice-president of global affairs and communications at Facebook, Nick Clegg will not spend all of his time dealing with issues of fake news, anonymous political adverts, and the selling of subscriber identities in Europe and North America (or, God forbid, explaining why Facebook should not pay more tax). As someone who studied anthropology at Cambridge University, Clegg needs to turn his attention to Asia, where there are more Facebook users than in North America and Europe combined, and specifically to India, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar, where Facebook and WhatsApp have played a key role in creating an environment where, in certain unfortunate places, the idea of pogroms and lynchings directed against Muslims have been normalised over the last couple of years. <br><strong>David Gellner</strong><br><em>Professor of social anthropology, and Fellow of All Souls, School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography, Oxford</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Join the debate – email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here to upload it</em></strong></a><strong><em> and we’ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b9f227a78abdcbc860626ae1e623c84cb89fd97/0_117_3500_2100/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/oct/21/space-travel-is-not-a-matter-of-genius","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-21T15:49:32Z","webTitle":"Space travel is not a matter of genius | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/21/space-travel-is-not-a-matter-of-genius","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/oct/21/space-travel-is-not-a-matter-of-genius","fields":{"headline":"Space travel is not a matter of genius","body":"<p>John Harris rightly points out the way in which space travel is increasingly driven by an anti-public ideology which claims that “the masses” have never “brought about innovation” (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/17/race-for-space-greed-nasa\" title=\"\">We once marvelled at Neil Armstrong.

In the world of media this is a moment of considerable significance. But the potential impact of the board’s verdict is much greater.</p> <p>Here’s why the relocation of this particular broadcaster matters far beyond the cacophonous republic of programme makers, digital entrepreneurs and aspiring film directors.</p> <p>The bidding process, overseen by Jonathan Allan, Channel 4’s chief commercial officer, has yielded a shortlist of three: Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Each of the cities has a decent claim to the prize – but it should unquestionably go to Birmingham, which has a hunger for the regeneration its presence would galvanise, and a civic trajectory that is perfect for Channel 4.</p> <p>Preparations for the Commonwealth Games in 2022 and the prospective arrival of the HS2 link have enlivened the UK’s “second city”, which was once known as the “workshop of the world”. Today, unemployment is falling across the West Midlands but it is still too high: the jobs that a “hero brand” such as Channel 4 would generate are badly needed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/15/channel-4-west-midlands-priority-says-mayor-andy-street\">Relocating Channel 4 to West Midlands is priority, says mayor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the city does not present itself as a hard-luck case. Quite the opposite: the municipal spirit that animated Joseph Chamberlain is surging once more. Birmingham’s digital infrastructure, <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/birmingham-getting-5g-mobile-first-15106412\" title=\"\">early rollout of 5G mobile capacity</a>, and the tech hub in nearby Leamington Spa are seriously impressive.</p> <p>And while it is true that MediaCityUK in Salford has been home to a chunk of the BBC machine since 2011, it is also certain that Channel 4 would be overshadowed in that setting. In Birmingham, it would be the unchallenged media-mafia family, a potent force in the life of the city from day one.</p> <p>True, Leeds claims to offer the diversity that Channel 4 is seeking in its new home. But it can scarcely compete with the unparalleled pluralism of Birmingham – whose population embraces more than 187 nationalities – or, crucially, the age demographic of the Midlands city.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/info/20102/jobs/490/working_in_birmingham\" title=\"\">More than 40% of Birmingham’s citizens are 25 and under</a>. And this – above all else – is what makes the city the ideal new location for this, of all broadcasters. As it approaches its fifth decade (and I’m old enough to remember its launch night), Channel 4 – facing competition from Amazon Prime, Netflix and YouTube – badly needs access to the pulsing marrow of youth. Even in the world of virtual business, the geographical setting of the modern corporation’s HQ still matters tremendously. If Channel 4 moves to Birmingham, it will be living amid its target audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d8376a4fd8efd3754544f438e48c49f348931dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d8376a4fd8efd3754544f438e48c49f348931dc/0_0_6126_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘More than 40% of Birmingham’s citizens are 25 and under.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"462\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘More than 40% of Birmingham’s citizens are 25 and under.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ChrisHepburn/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Soaring above the bid decision itself, there is an even greater principle at stake. For as long as I can remember, senior ministers have been paying lip service to the argument that London’s grip on the life of the nation is seriously excessive, and that more attention must be paid to what is variously called “decentralisation”, “devolution”, “regionalisation” and much else besides.</p> <p>Not all of it is verbiage. There are now devolved assemblies in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Stormont (the last suspended, it is true, since January 2017); six metro mayors, most notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/15/channel-4-west-midlands-priority-says-mayor-andy-street\" title=\"\">Andy Street</a> in Birmingham and Andy Burnham in Manchester, and the “northern powerhouse” established by George Osborne.</p> <p>Still, the gravitational pull of London remains overwhelming. Even when power is parcelled out from Whitehall, its recipients are left in no doubt that the real action remains in the Big Smoke. The BBC’s presence in Salford is important. But, come on: the big decisions are taken in New Broadcasting House in London, and everyone knows it.</p> <p>What makes Channel 4’s relocation so remarkable is that it absolutely does not fit this pattern. For once, a blue-chip national institution with global reach really will be leaving London. And – though the move involves only a single company and 300 employees – its ripple effect is potentially immense. For the first time, a front-rank media organisation at the heart of the nation’s cultural life will be unambiguously based outside the capital. I can already sense the panic in the clubs and bars of Soho.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/07/birmingham-uk-city-oxford-reading-pwc-demos\">Birmingham is fastest-improving city to live and work, says study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And you know what? It’ll be good for them (which, if you work for a national newspaper in London, is also to say: for us). I have lived in the capital all my life, and make no apology for loving it. But it would be idle to deny that its overwhelming dominance in almost every sector has frayed the social cohesion and economic balance of this country.</p> <p>As far as the rest of the UK was concerned, it was London that came up with the double whammy of the crash and austerity – and everyone else who picked up the tab. It is impossible to understand the 2016 vote for Brexit without acknowledging the strength of this resentment: the feeling that an ill-defined “metropolitan elite” has long treated the rest of the UK as an annex to its glorious Renaissance city-state, and as the lucky beneficiary of its munificence.</p> <p>The best way to deal with such broiling sentiments is not to argue but to take action. The relocation of Channel 4 to Birmingham would show that London is ready to devolve human capital and cultural muscle, as well as to subsidise local organisations kept on a tight leash from the centre; that it is truly prepared, at last, to let go of some of its greatest assets.</p> <p>Brexit has inspired an often frantic debate about what sort of country we want to be. Let’s be in no doubt that this is part of the answer.</p> <p>• Matthew d’Ancona is a Guardian columnist</p>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/92f977dc4ef779d3f3d450bc190eb90ab86a1970/0_2277_4096_2458/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/live/2018/oct/21/everton-v-crystal-palace-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-21T15:48:26Z","webTitle":"Everton v Crystal Palace: Premier League – live!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/oct/21/everton-v-crystal-palace-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/oct/21/everton-v-crystal-palace-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Everton v Crystal Palace: Premier League – live!","body":"<div id=\"block-5bcc9f74e4b0c2d58c1b4443\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-21T15:48:10.178Z\">4.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Half-time: Everton 0-0 Crystal Palace</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Honestly, it was worse than you think it was.

And it’s been like this for 30 years; as Juice Terry taught, variety is the spice ay life, but what when all you get is variety? Is it still variety then? Riddle me that, clever-clogs. </p> <p>Their latest attempt at reinvention is still in its embryonic stages, but there are signs of something. Richarlison looks a wise purchase even at the price, Gylfi Sigurdsson is doing what he was signed to do, and Theo Walcott has added thrust. They’ve no business whatsoever being 11th in the table, and will see Palace at home as a fair way to remedy that. </p> <p>Palace, though, have more than enough to give them grief. Aaron Wan-Bissaka has the ability to go to the top and on the other flank, Patrick van Aanholt is also not to be messed with. In midfield, they have legs and pace – though perhaps not enough craft – and then across the front line can be found Wilfried Zaha, a flashing, skating, spinning disco ball of a footballer able to make the difference in any game.

New to this set is one Nick Clegg, less a politician and more of a living Faustian tragedy. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/09/nick-clegg-sheffield-hallam-no-longer-agrees-with-you\" title=\"\">crashing out</a> in the big Liberal Democrat electoral meltdown of 2017, he has announced that he will be joining Facebook as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/19/facebook-hires-nick-clegg-as-head-of-global-affairs\" title=\"\">head of global affairs</a>.</p> <p>The optics are bad.

The news that he is moving to California came a day before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/20/70000-demand-new-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">anti-Brexit march on Saturday</a>. His explanation for his decision, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/19/nick-clegg-facebook-politics-tech\" title=\"\">published in the Guardian</a>, reads like a sheepish but also chippy apology. He says he has “mixed feelings about leaving the UK’s public debate about the future of our country’s relations with the rest of Europe”, but that “the Brexit drama will soon move to the place where it arguably belonged all along, in parliament”. He isn’t an MP and fighting Brexit is important, but it’s not a career, goddamit. Nick Clegg is, quite simply, fleeing the scene. Accusations of a blase elite bailing out whenever things get too choppy seem unavoidable.</p> <p>During Barack Obama’s first presidential election campaign, a BBC journalist visited a traditionally Republican southern state, interviewing its white voters about Obama’s prospects. “Do you think being black harms his chances here?” he asked one man having a drink at a bar. “Well,” the man replied, “it doesn’t help!” Clegg’s move might not harm the anti-Brexit campaign, but it sure doesn’t help. It already has to contend with complaints of elitist metropolitanism from authentocrats who will not rest until every last remainer is a dust-smeared chimney sweep. A defence Clegg could have done without came in the shape of Chuka Umunna insisting that Clegg is “a private citizen” and can do whatever he wants. Umunna’s endorsement was part of an LBC interview on Saturday morning in which he had to answer questions about his own lucrative new role, a side gig as chair of a centrist thinktank that is paying him <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/chuka-umunna-centrist-think-tank-65000\" title=\"\">£65,000 a year</a> for 12 hours of work a month.</p> <p>All this does not sit well, for the same reason Bill and Hillary Clinton’s years of <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2016/11/08/how-bill-house-hillary-clinton-made-240-million-how-much-earnings-rich-white/\" title=\"\">hectic money-making</a> stick in the craw: the sense that their politics is about brand, rather than values. To spend your tenure campaigning for social justice and equality only to leverage that for personal enrichment is exploitative of those who voted for you, and raises questions about sincerity. It makes your time in politics seem like an extended interview and networking opportunity. Already Clegg must have either tempered or jettisoned his objections to tax avoidance. On an income of £1.3bn, Facebook’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/08/facebook-uk-tax-bill-sales-margaret-hodge\" title=\"\">latest UK tax bill</a> was £15.8m.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/21/if-youre-on-the-side-of-democracy-why-are-you-going-to-work-for-facebook\">If you’re on the side of democracy, Nick Clegg, why are you going to work for Facebook? | Carole Cadwalladr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is true, Clegg is a private citizen who can make money how he pleases. Umunna can be “fed up” with the “liberal metropolitan elite smear” and still get paid £450 an hour if it suits him. But the nature of a politician’s extra- and post-curricular activities is a tell, an insight into the extent to which they are motivated by career as opposed to cause. Public service is not a pit stop. Despite Clegg’s new belief in the power of Facebook to “build bridges” (for £1m a year before stock options and bonuses), and his forlorn “mixed feelings” about checking out, work for the common good can continue long after one has left parliament. Indeed, it is especially urgent a calling right now: Brexit demands every resource be marshalled. But then Clegg’s decamping is a good reminder of what landed us with Brexit in the first place – the recklessness of politicians for whom the stakes are very different. Thanks for nothing, Nick. The people will take it from here.</p> <p>• Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b9f227a78abdcbc860626ae1e623c84cb89fd97/0_195_3500_2100/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/oct/21/trump-playful-assault-guardian-reporter-ben-sasse","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-21T14:54:46Z","webTitle":"Trump was 'playful' in praising assault on Guardian reporter, Ben Sasse says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/21/trump-playful-assault-guardian-reporter-ben-sasse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/oct/21/trump-playful-assault-guardian-reporter-ben-sasse","fields":{"headline":"Trump was 'playful' in praising assault on Guardian reporter, Ben Sasse says","body":"<p>Donald Trump was being “playful” when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/18/trump-greg-gianforte-assault-guardian-ben-jacobs\">praised</a> a Montana congressman who assaulted a Guardian reporter, said a Republican senator whose new book sets out to “heal” America’s glaring political divide.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/18/trump-greg-gianforte-assault-guardian-ben-jacobs\">'He's my guy': Donald Trump praises Gianforte for assault on Guardian reporter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In Missoula, Montana on Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/18/trump-greg-gianforte-assault-guardian-ben-jacobs\">Trump discussed Greg Gianforte’s attack on Ben Jacobs</a>, which happened in May 2017 when Jacobs asked the then candidate a question about healthcare.

The ITF said this was needed to give the Russians stuck at Aberdeen airport leave to enter.</p> <p>An ITF inspection on board the crane ship in the Moray Firth the following month found more than 140 migrant workers, the majority from Russia and some from Indonesia.</p> <p>Contracts for some of these workers, seen by the Guardian, set rates of pay that were a fraction of the UK minimum wage.</p> <p>In the immigration <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/704445/Wind_farm_concession.pdf\">concession</a> the Home Office said: “Firms involved in the construction and maintenance of windfarms within territorial waters should look to regularise the position of their workers.” However the concession has since been extended twice and is now valid until April 2019.</p> <p>Amber Rudd, home secretary at the time of the concession, had been energy secretary when the Beatrice project was launched, and <a href=\"http://sse.com/newsandviews/allarticles/2016/05/green-light-for-beatrice-offshore-wind-farm/\">promised</a> it would “provide home-grown clean energy boosting skills and create jobs and financial security for working people and their families in Scotland, and across the UK”.</p> <p>The Beatrice windfarm <a href=\"https://www.beatricewind.com/\">project</a> is a joint venture led by the privatised utility Scottish and Southern Electricity (SSE), and is one of the largest investments made in Scottish infrastructure. It is due to be completed next year.</p> <p>The SSE consortium won a licence to develop the wind farm in UK territorial waters, with pledges that it would aim to recruit locally. It subcontracted part of the construction to a leading firm specialising in offshore operations, <a href=\"https://www.seawayheavylifting.com.cy/mediacenter/news-press/major-beatrice-epci-contract-for-seaway-heavy-lifting\">Seaway Heavy Lifting</a> (SHL).</p> <p>SHL deployed one of its giant crane ships, the Stanislav Yudin, to work on the project a few miles from the Scottish coast.</p> <p>Contracts issued by SHL and an agent to Russian workers arriving to join the Stanislav Yudin in 2017 were for 12-hour days, seven days a week while at sea – at just £58 to £68 per day. Some workers were receiving less than £5 an hour when the national minimum wage was £7.50.</p> <p>SSE and its subcontractor say migrant worker contracts were altered when they became aware of irregularities, but according to the unions, the Beatrice example exposes a lack of adequate enforcement and regulation in the booming sector.</p> <p>SHL said the concession was industry-wide and it was “committed to carrying out its business in an ethical manner. We have been working closely with the Home Office and relevant industry bodies regarding concerns raised around the employment of non-EEA nationals in UK territorial waters. We continue to work to ensure we meet all applicable regulations.”</p> <p>An SSE spokeswoman said: “SSE, and its project partners, take any potential breach of UK immigration law by its contractors extremely seriously and each of [Beatrice’s] suppliers is contractually required to fully comply with UK law, including obtaining all relevant work permits and paying at least the national minimum wage.</p> <p>“SSE, along with its [Beatrice] partners, took action as soon as the issue came to light to ensure SHL was meeting its contractual and legal obligations.”</p> <p>The government has provided generous subsidises to Beatrice and other wind farms, and jobs in the sector are seen as particularly important to Scotland and the north-east.</p> <p>The Guardian has identified several other low-paid migrant workers being used on guard vessels for other windfarm construction and offshore cable-laying sites.</p> <p>Local fishing trawlers often take on contracts for this guard duty as a lucrative way to supplement their income when they have run out of fishing quota, and many depend on it for survival. Several workers brought in from Ghana are doing these jobs, at a reported rate of £1,050 per month, with hourly pay well below the UK national minimum wage. </p> <p>The ITF maritime coordinator, Jacqueline Smith, said it had become aware of a sharp increase in the number of Filipino and Ghanaians on board trawlers in recent months, which it suspects relates to the increase in offshore wind farm activity.</p> <p>The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, called on the government to enforce the law and prevent the offshore industry importing cheap labour.</p> <p>The Department of Business, Energy andIndustrial Strategy said any workers under the concession not receiving their entitlement to the national minimum wage could contact the conciliation service Acas and that HMRC was committed to cracking down on employers who break the law.</p> <p>HMRC declined to say whether it was investigating any breaches.</p> <p>The Home Office said it “agreed to grant a concession as a temporary arrangement, outside of the immigration rules, to workers deemed to be essential to the construction and maintenance of wind farms within territorial waters.</p> <p>“This temporary arrangement was put in place to give the industry the opportunity to regularise its arrangements for their employees.

For a month-long trial period, the company will collect every plastic bottle of at least 500ml brought into the car park.

Money’s tight. We thought, ‘What can we do to make a difference?’ It’s getting more popular as word gets out, but we’re conscious that we need to get the information to the public.”</p> <p>I wait in vain for someone to turn up with any bottles, but of the motorists I speak to who were unaware of the scheme, all promise to participate. Meanwhile, Bedford says “doing my bit” makes him happier in his job, and CitiPark does have one happy recycler: me.
