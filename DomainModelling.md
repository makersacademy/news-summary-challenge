THE IDEA - 

***CLASSES***

Class Article
 - Object should include the following:
 * Headline
 * Summary
 * Image (from url)
 * Link to original page

Class List of Articles
- This should allow us to reference all article objects at once

Basic Function: View all headlines
Basic Function: View all images

Added Function: Expand headline to view summary
Added Function: Direct to page of origin when clicking on link contained in **summary title**

Advanced Function: Have mobile capability
Advanced Function: Add whizzy animations (What does this mean? Who knows!)

WHAT DATA DO WE NEED - 

* Title (from Guardian)
* Url (from Guardian)
* Summary text (from Aylien)
* Image (from ??????)

--------------

***DOMAIN PAGES***

Although this is only on 'one page', we'll need

* A splash page of all headlines
* A summary page for when a person clicks on a headline
