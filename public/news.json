Instead of welcoming people fleeing poverty and war, its indifference and cynical disregard had continued to condemn people to death, he said.</p> <p>“Sisters and brothers, I am here on Lesbos to say I am near you, to look into your eyes full of fear and expectancy, eyes that have seen violence and poverty, “ the pope told a group of immigrants on Sunday. “Migration is a humanitarian crisis that concerns everyone.”</p> <p>In an emblematic move seen as a defining moment for his papacy, Francis came to the island at the height of the migration drama in 2016. There he sent a message to Europe’s political elite by flying back to Rome with a group of Syrian refugees on his plane. The gesture appeared to usher in a new era of compassion and goodwill towards people seeking solace, often in the face of great adversity.</p> <p>Yet Europe had failed to heed the lessons from history, the pope lamented on Sunday as he addressed people seeking asylum and officials who has gathered under a tent within view of a migration camp. In the intervening years, the Mediterranean had been allowed to become a “desolate sea of death” where smugglers’ boats packed with desperate people sank, the pope said.</p> <p>“Please let us stop this shipwreck of civilisation,” he added, deploring a decision adopted by many EU countries to build walls along their borders to keep refugees out.</p> <p>Turning to Greek officials, including Greece’s president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, who was also in Lesbos for the visit, the pope said: “I ask every man and woman, all of us, to overcome the paralysis of fear, the indifference that kills, the cynical disregard that nonchalantly condemns to death those on the fringes,”</p> <p>Francis, who turns 85 later this month, looked animated as he patted children on the head and engaged with men and women lined up around the facility.</p> <p>The pope, himself the son of Italian immigrants who moved to Argentina, has made the defence of refugees a cornerstone of his eight-year papacy.<br>On Saturday, shortly after he arrived in Athens, he criticised Europe for the divisions it has exhibited over migration, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/04/pope-francis-criticises-europes-divided-response-to-migration-crisis\">warned</a> against the perils of populism and expressed concern over democracy’s retreat globally.</p> <p>While in Cyprus, his first stop, the pope condemned what he described as the “slavery” and “torture” often suffered by those fleeing war and poverty.</p> <p>“It reminds us of the history of the last century, of the Nazis, of Stalin,” he said at a prayer service held for immigrants coalesced in Nicosia, the island’s divided capital. “And we wonder how this could have happened.”</p> <p>But Francis, who arranged for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/02/pope-pledges-to-relocate-50-asylum-seekers-to-italy\">relocation</a> of 50 asylum seekers from Cyprus to Rome, reserved his harshest language for the Greek end of his tour.</p> <p>Citing Athens not only as the birthplace of democracy but where “man first became conscious of being a political animal”, he expressed fears over the disenchanted being lured by the “siren songs of authoritarianism” and warned against populists promising popular but unrealistic solutions.</p> <p>Close to one million people, many fleeing war in Syria, traversed Greece between 2015 and 2016.

That’s <em>Aston Villa </em>v <em>Leicester</em>. It bears repeating because much of the pre-match chatter has involved three other clubs: Celtic, Rangers and Liverpool. </p> <p>Villa manager Steven Gerrard is a former manager of Rangers and possibly a future manager of Liverpool; Brendan Rodgers has done time at both Celtic and Liverpool, where he would surely have won the title but for an impossibly cruel slip by Gerrard. </p> <p>Gerrard aspires to make Villa the Midlands’ best club, and since their promotion in 2019 they have got much closer to Leicester. There were 27 points between the teams in 2019-20 but only 11 last season. And if Villa win today, they will go above Leicester and move two points behind Wolves.</p> <p>They’ve made a promising start under Gerrard, with two wins and a dignified defeat to Manchester City. Leicester, not helped by more miserable luck with injuries, have been unusually scruffy this season. But there have been encouraging signs in recent weeks, not least a return to form from the ghost of Euro 2020, James Maddison. to his infectious best.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>4.30pm.<br></p> </div>   </div>",

Some also carried signs critical of vaccines and against making the coronavirus shots mandatary, the AP said.</p> \n<p>On Friday, the Belgian prime minister <strong>Alexander De Croo</strong> announced that kindergartens and primary schools will close for the holiday season a week early, and that children must now wear masks from the age of six. Indoor events will only be allowed with a maximum of 200 people.</p> \n<p>The AP reports that, previously, the government closed nightclubs and ordered bars and restaurants to shut at 11pm for three weeks. Speculation had been rife that closing times would be brought forward to 8pm but the cabinet decided against it, for now.</p> \n<p>According to the latest coronavirus figures, the nation of 11 million people appears to have reached a plateau. On a weekly average, 17,862 new daily cases were reported, a rise of 6% over the previous week. Hospital admissions rose 4%. More than 3,700 people are in hospital with the virus, 821 of them in intensive care. More than 27,000 people have died since the outbreak began last year.</p>"

The most populous state, New South Wales, reported two more cases on Sunday, bringing the total to 15, and the Australian Capital Territory confirmed its second. Parliament House was closed over the weekend to the public until further notice after a staffer to a member of parliament tested positive following the legislature’s final sitting week of the year on Friday. The variant of that infection case has not been disclosed, but health authorities said the staff was fully vaccinated. While nationwide vaccinations are voluntary, states and territories have mandated shots for many occupations, and some require full vaccination to access most hospitality services and non-essential retail. Australia’s overall childhood immunisation coverage is also one of the highest in the world, with 95% of five-year-olds inoculated with vaccines recommended for their age, health data show.

Javid has said:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Christmas is around the corner and it’s absolutely crucial that everybody who is eligible gets their booster jab to top-up their immunity before spending time with loved ones.</p> \n <p>While our brilliant scientists learn more about the new Omicron variant, we need to do everything we can to strengthen our defences and vaccines are the best way to do that.</p> \n <p>This is a national mission and we all have a role to play - so roll up your sleeves and get protected as soon as you can.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>At the same time, India has reported a heavy single-day death toll; based in part on revisions to earlier figures.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n<p> The eastern state of Bihar added 2,426 unrecorded deaths, while the southern state of Kerala added 263 deaths to their tallies on Sunday, a federal health ministry spokesperson has told the Reuters news agency. The revised figures took single-day deaths to 2,796, the highest since 21 July, according to a Reuters tally.</p> \n<p>A devastating second wave in March and April this year saw thousands of deaths and millions affected. Indian states have continued to add unreported deaths in recent months; lending weight to some medical experts’ opinions that such deaths are much higher than the reported number of 473,326. The practise also means the latest figures may not necessarily be a reflection of the actual daily death toll.</p>"

Whoever reaches seven and a half points first will be declared the champion. (Carlsen leads 4-3 over Nepomniachtchi at the midpoint.)<br></p> <p>The time control for each game is 120 minutes for the first 40 moves, 60 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 61.</p> <p>If the match is tied after 14 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day (16 December) in the following order:</p> <p>• Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.</p> <p>• If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment).</p> <p>• If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death ‘Armageddon’ match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes. Both players will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. In the case of a draw, Black will be declared the winner.</p> <p>Notably, Carlsen’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/01/magnus-carlsen-retains-world-chess-title-after-quickfire-tie-breaker\">second</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/nov/28/magnus-carlsen-v-fabiano-caruana-world-chess-championship-tie-breakers-live\">third</a> title defenses both came down to tiebreakers.

But not long after the world No 1 gave up his stronghold in the center with the committal 17 exd4, a flurry of rapid simplification began and the action fizzled out fast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Magnus Carlsen v Ian Nepomniachtchi: World Chess Championship\">  <iframe width=600 height=371 src=\"https://lichess.org/study/embed/gHaonHgE/pj0enFPB#0\" frameborder=0></iframe> </figure>  <p>For anyone just coming aboard, Carlsen, who turned 31 on Tuesday, has been at No 1 in the Fide rankings for 10 straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he dethroned Vishy Anand for the title in 2013.

Fred had the final word, though, with a sweet first-time finish that earned the three points.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-12-05T15:57:52.381Z\">at 3.57pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-61ace0848f08133e170ffc57\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-12-05T15:54:40.236Z\">3.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 min + 3: </strong>Palace aren’t finished and win a corner but they fluff the execution, the ball dropping to Zaha on the edge of the area, who miskicks completely ... will that be their last chance?</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-61acdffb8f087dc3fe3f175d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-12-05T15:52:55.285Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 min +1: </strong>Palace break with pace down the left – Lindelöf is exposed one-on-one against Zaha.

Is Harry Maguire a League One-level clogger or a Franz Beckenbauer-in-waiting? Are Manchester United a serious football club or more a social media content provider?

One wonders if, in all the excitement, Rangnick had time to watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2021/dec/04/west-ham-v-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-updates\">Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea fall at West Ham yesterday</a> largely due to a succession of glaring individual errors. After much hype and speculation, this afternoon we’ll have the first tangible evidence of what the ‘godfather of gegenpressing’ is going to bring to Manchester United and the Premier League.</p> <p>There is no shortage of plots and sub-plots as far as Manchester United are concerned, then, and post-Roy Hodgson Crystal Palace are writing an interesting story of their own this season. Patrick Vieira’s fresh approach has energised the squad, with Conor Gallagher bossing the midfield at times, and it is not too long since they came to Manchester and bloodied the noses of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/30/manchester-city-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Pep Guardiola and City</a>.

We worked so hard after the international break so make sure we got it tactically right. Second half we sat off a little bit more but I think we blew them away first half especially. My goal settled our nerves a little bit. When you’re through on goal its a stressful situation but I managed to stay composed and put it in but it was a magnificent performance from everyone - keeping a clean sheet in the final is amazing. Overall I think we deserved to win and could have cored a few more goals. It’s a massive day for women’s football. Today was about not forgetting the trailblazers who helped us get here. Hopefully the performance today made everyone proud and hopefully more people want to get involved in women’s football.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-61ace6fd8f087dc3fe3f17c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-12-05T16:25:50.561Z\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And here’s Emma Hayes: </strong>“I’m extremely proud of everyone in our organisation. Our performance was out of this world today. we were dominant from start to finish. I was upset we weren’t up by more than one at half-time but it was convincing in the end. That’s the best performance I’ve seen from Fran [Kirby], she ran the show. The midfield was set up to do a job and allow Fran and Sam [Kerr] to go and play. It’s nice to paint Wembley blue tonight. It’s a Chelsea day. The fans deserve that. Winning the treble is an amazing achievement and I will sit down and enjoy that this evening. Women’s football was banned 100 years ago. I said to the girls before the game: today we play for everyone who’s made the women’s game what it is. Women’s football is out livelihood but it’s also our passion and today that win was for every woman who’s been involved in women’s football in this country.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-61ace46a8f08b914bbcf539d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-12-05T16:13:11.445Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Last up is Magdalena Eriksson</strong>, who collects the cup and goes to join her teammates in the huddle, hoisting it aloft and being instantly soaked in a tidal wave of champagne.

Atherton CC were skittled for 68 by Astley and Tyldesley Collieries, who sneaked to victory by one wicket. I know this because the scores from that league were printed in the Guardian the following day. So were results from the Cross Cup, and the Glossop League, and the Shettleston Marathon, and the North of England Lacrosse League, and the Longwood 10-mile Road Race, and I’m genuinely not making any of this up.</p> <p>One sporting event was, or rather is, conspicuous by its absence: the inaugural Women’s FA Cup final. Nada. Zilch. Sweet bugger all. Not even the scoreline. (Southampton beat Stewarton Thistle 4-1, with Pat Davies scoring a hat-trick.) The world has changed since the heyday of DCI Gene Hunt, and it’s not just the Guardian that has embraced women’s football. Today’s final between Arsenal and Chelsea will be a celebration of 50 years of the FA Cup, and of how good the sport has become.</p> <p>The sheer quality of both teams makes this the perfect final. It’s also a riddle of the future: <em>in which season did the two best teams in the country meet in the FA Cup final, having finished first and third in the league? </em></p> <p>The answer, obviously, is 2020-21. This match belongs to last season, when Arsenal finished behind Chelsea and Manchester City, and is being played now because of the backlog caused by Covid. Arsenal have replaced City as Chelsea’s main rivals this season, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/dec/03/eidevall-hopes-fa-cup-final-showpiece-will-see-luck-land-on-arsenals-side\">whatever Emma Hayes says publicly</a>, and the two are involved in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/womens-super-league/table\">a cracking race for the title</a>.</p> <p>One of them will make history today. Either Arsenal will win the FA Cup for a record-extending 15th time, or Chelsea will do so for the third – and, more significantly, complete their first domestic treble.</p> <p>Most importantly of all, the result will be in every newspaper tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>2pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-12-05T12:31:53.401Z\">at 12.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

It’s not surprising – between squeezing in four months’ worth of social catchups, pre-holiday sales and every beauty appointment under the sun, there’s suddenly a lot more things to spend money on.</p> <p>But even as we embrace the pub with new gusto, there are ways to mitigate the financial damage. Here financial advisers share a few relatively pain-free tips for getting your money in order after lockdown.</p> <h2><strong>Revisit your budget</strong></h2> <p>The first step to taking charge of your finances is always creating a budget – but make sure you’re doing it the right way.</p> <p>“A lot of people think that budgeting is about restriction and limiting your spending, when in reality it should be you fully comprehending what you’re actually spending every week,” says Victoria Devine, author, financial adviser and host of the podcast She’s on the Money.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jul/10/dont-spend-the-difference-where-to-put-your-money-if-you-cant-buy-your-own-home\">‘Don’t spend the difference’: where to put your money if you can’t buy your own home</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To budget properly, look at your bank account to see how much you actually spend on essential things like groceries – not what you <em>want</em> to spend. That way, Devine says, “you can align your budget and your money goals to your actual spending”.</p> <p>The pandemic may have changed what you consider “essential” – for instance, Devine says, “if you found yourself thriving without a gym membership during lockdown, I think that’s something you could ditch from your budget”.</p> <h2><strong>Cancel those subscriptions</strong></h2> <p>Speaking of gym memberships, when yours reopened they may have started charging you again – even if you are no longer attending. Add to that signing up for every streaming service imaginable during lockdown, and it means it is time to take stock of your monthly subscriptions, and scrap the ones you aren’t actually using.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2fa3c1354195007fd49b57b7d0d4b057bd1efe2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2fa3c1354195007fd49b57b7d0d4b057bd1efe2/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A television with dozens of streaming services displayed, and a remote in the foreground of the photograph\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Small recurring expenses like streaming subscriptions can quickly add up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: simpson33/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Monthly subscriptions can be death by 1000 cuts,” says Hamish Landreth, a financial consultant at Prosperity Wealth Advisers. “A lot of people take the view of, ‘oh, what’s another $10 a month?’ But those small recurring expenses can very quickly end up as quite a large annual outflow.”</p> <p>Check over your bank statements to get a clear picture of what you are paying for each month. “If you are committing to an ongoing subscription or payment, it’s important to make sure it’s something you’re actually getting value in and not just paying out a force of habit,” Landreth says.</p> <h2><strong>Curb online shopping</strong></h2> <p>Similarly, if you became passionate about, ahem, supporting small business during the Delta days, Landreth suggests putting a cap on things.</p> <p>“Coming out of lockdown it is realistic to assume some expenses, like petrol costs or work lunches, are going to increase,” Landreth says. “Try and offset these extra costs by cutting back on meal deliveries or setting some limits on online shopping.”</p> <h2><strong>Automate your holiday fund</strong></h2> <p>If you’re (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/sep/20/the-great-australian-holiday-gamble-can-we-covid-proof-our-travel-plans\">perhaps optimistically</a>) considering an overseas holiday in 2022, now’s the time to start saving. The best way to do this, Devine says, is to set up automatic transfers. First, open a savings account with a different institution to your everyday account, so “it’s out of sight out of mind”. Then arrange the automatic transfer for the same day your salary is deposited.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/jun/16/want-to-stick-to-your-budget-open-six-bank-accounts\">Want to stick to your budget? Open six bank accounts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s the set-and-forget approach to saving. “[Automation] can actually be a really good tool for people who don’t want to do too much with their money,” Devine says.</p> <h2><strong>Check your income protection</strong></h2> <p>Are you one of the Australians who changed careers during the pandemic? If so, you should check your income protection is still in line with your current salary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d0fc997e41c708835770a1065d8d5530ab69564\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d0fc997e41c708835770a1065d8d5530ab69564/0_0_6985_4657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bartender at restaurant collects payment from customer using contactless payment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If your wage has changed during the pandemic, it is worth revisiting your income protection insurance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fly View Productions/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“If there’s been a change in employment, you need to make sure that what you’re covered for is consistent with what you’re earning,” Landreth says. “So if people have changed jobs or their salaries are different, it’s worth making sure that the benefit amount remains appropriate.”</p> <p>And if, um, you don’t even have income protection?</p> <p>“Not everyone has it,” Landreth says. “But I would say it should be a very high priority for people that have financial responsibilities, either to a mortgage or to dependents, or anyone that would be in a serious situation if their ability to earn an income was taken away.”</p> <p>He says this insurance essentially replaces your income if you’re unable to work for medical reasons. “It’s sort of like unlimited sick leave, if you will.”</p> <h2><strong>Look at your loans</strong></h2> <p>If you’ve got a mortgage, car loan or some credit card debt, this could be a good moment to refinance it, Landreth says. This isn’t particularly pandemic related – it’s just something worth doing from time to time to avoid paying what’s known as the loyalty tax or, less generously, “lazy tax”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/31/ripped-off-how-the-lazy-tax-could-be-costing-you-hundreds-of-dollars\">Ripped off: How the 'lazy tax' could be costing you hundreds of dollars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It’s a bit of a trend, unfortunately, that banks will often offer the best rates to new customers, often at the expense of their existing customers,” he explains. “If you’re a regular customer that never makes an inquiry, oftentimes you’re being overcharged on your interest rates. Whereas the customers that call up and ask for discounts or shop around are the ones getting the best rates.”</p> <h2><strong>Cut yourself some slack</strong></h2> <p>When all’s said and done, this is a moment in history when it’s OK to be a little less than perfect with our finances. Devine recommends planning to spend more than we usually would over the next month or so – especially as we’re also going into the festive season.</p> <p>“We need to give ourselves a tiny bit of permission to spend a little bit more. It’s actually OK to go out for an additional glass of wine with a couple of friends right now,” Devine says.</p> <p>“I feel like this could be classified as a little bit of self-care. It’s looking after your family, nourishing yourself and filling your cup back up after what has been arguably a pretty traumatic experience.”</p> <p>Now that’s financial advice that’s easy to get on board with.</p>",

The best way to do this, Devine says, is to set up automatic transfers. First, open a savings account with a different institution to your everyday account, so “it’s out of sight out of mind”. Then arrange the automatic transfer for the same day your salary is deposited.</p>"

The funding includes, among other things, a $5m marketing strategy to attract teachers, and a plan to poach 500 science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) teachers from other states and jurisdictions.</p> \n<p>Other states, such as Western Australia, recently announced their own plans to poach teachers from NSW.</p> \n<p>Labor has seized on responses provided by the government to supplementary budget estimates questions which show half of the $125m is yet to be allocated. According to the government, about $63m of the fund is still being “refined as initiatives are scoped and implemented”.</p> \n<p>The responses also show the government’s plan to poach Stem teachers was based in part on “anecdotal evidence” that teachers from interstate and overseas were “interested in returning home to NSW especially during the Covid-19 pandemic”.</p>"

It’s a piecemeal solution.</p> <p>“It calls into question whether the NSW government is genuinely committed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/07/zero-extinction-target-for-nsw-national-parks-welcomed-by-environment-groups\">zero extinctions </a>of native wildlife within its national parks.”</p> <p>Mark Lintermans is a threatened-fish ecologist and associate professor at the University of Canberra.</p> <p>Lintermans is an expert on the species and organised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/05/freshwater-hell-scientists-race-save-endangered-fish--bushfire-ash-stocky-galaxias\">a rescue mission</a> in the Kosciuszko after the black summer fires.

The ideal thing would be to remove horses altogether,” Lintermans said.</p> <p>Don Driscoll, the director of the centre for integrative ecology at Deakin University, said fences were prone to damage from snow drift and fires.</p> <p>He said by managing the threat caused to the fish in this way, the state government “was turning a national park into a farm so they can manage these horses which are essentially farm animals”.</p> <p>“There’s a whole suite of species and ecosystems, not just the stocky galaxias, which are left inside areas where they’re going to retain horses.</p> <p>“It means these species and ecosystems will continue to decline in the horse retention areas, which is not the way people expect a national park to be managed.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the federal environment department said the environment minister, Sussan Ley, “has been advised about the plan and is aware of public commentary on it”.</p> <p>“Implementation arrangements are a matter for the NSW government,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>“The minister will actively monitor the state’s implementation of the plan.”</p> <p>Comment was sought from the NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, whose office referred questions to the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment.</p> <p>A department spokesperson said the national parks and wildlife service was working with NSW fisheries to link ponds at a site in Eucumbene to “provide the best possible additional insurance habitat for the Tantangara galaxias”.</p> <p>The spokesperson said the draft plan received more than 4,000 submissions and all had been considered before adopting the final plan.</p> <p>“Stocky galaxias at Tantangara Creek are located in an area where wild horse densities will be reduced. The species will benefit from a substantial reduction (approximately 75%) in the density of wild horses,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>“The plan provides for exclusion fencing where considered necessary to protect high value assets over the short to medium term while the wild horse population is reduced using other methods of control.”<br></p>",

              "bodyTextSummary": "A New South Wales government plan to control feral horses in Kosciuszko national park will allow horses to remain in the only known habitat of one of Australia’s most imperilled freshwater fishes and risks pushing the species closer to extinction. Conservationists say allowing horses to continue to roam around some sections of the park will put vulnerable wildlife and ecosystems at risk. They include the stocky galaxias, a fish that was listed as critically endangered last year following the 2019-20 bushfires and was recently named as one of 100 priority animals in the Morrison government’s new threatened species strategy. The fish is one of the 22 most endangered freshwater species in Australia.\nUnder the final NSW management plan, feral horses will be retained in the area around Tantangara Creek, which for years has been the only known habitat for the stocky galaxias. The final plan, released late last month after years of deadlock, would see horse numbers reduced from about 14,000 to 3,000. It would remove horses entirely from some areas but they would still be able to roam 32% of the park. The main threat to the survival of stocky galaxias is invasive trout but feral horses are also listed as a key pressure because of damage they cause to its habitat, including breeding sites, by causing silt and mud to flow into streams. To address the problem, NSW parks staff erected a fence around the creek earlier this year to exclude horses but conservation groups and ecologists say it would be better if the animals were removed altogether. They said the impact of horses, combined with other pressures including likely impacts from the Snowy 2.0 project, will put the fish at risk of further decline.\n“Locking in feral horse damage to the habitat of stocky galaxias, combined with the impacts of Snowy 2.0, is potentially a death sentence for this species,” said James Trezise, the conservation director at the Invasive Species Council. “It now means park managers are building fences inside one of Australia’s premier national parks rather than controlling a feral invasive animal. It’s a piecemeal solution. “It calls into question whether the NSW government is genuinely committed to zero extinctions of native wildlife within its national parks.” Mark Lintermans is a threatened-fish ecologist and associate professor at the University of Canberra. Lintermans is an expert on the species and organised a rescue mission in the Kosciuszko after the black summer fires. He has been outspoken on threats to the species and resigned from the NSW Fisheries Scientific Committee over the potential for the Snowy 2.0 project to introduce invasive fish into the stocky galaxias habitat. Lintermans said the recent construction of the fence would greatly reduce the threat caused by horses at Tantangara Creek but would not address the broader damage the animals caused to streams in the Kosciuszko national park. He has also recently discovered another smaller population of stocky galaxias about 30km from Tantangara Creek in the Upper Goodradigbee catchment, with the discovery due for publication in a research journal. Lintermans said the final NSW plan also retained horses in this second area of habitat. “It’s in an even smaller stream than Tantangara and an even smaller extent of stream,” he said. Lintermans said if there were other remnant populations still around, they would be totally unprotected by the fencing at Tantangara Creek. He said there was also another species, the Riek’s spiny crayfish, which was identified by the federal government as a priority species after the fires and is now being considered for a threatened listing under national laws.\nHorses cause damage to its habitat and burrows and the final management plan would see them retained in areas of the park where the species is found. “You can’t do one million little bits of fencing. The ideal thing would be to remove horses altogether,” Lintermans said. Don Driscoll, the director of the centre for integrative ecology at Deakin University, said fences were prone to damage from snow drift and fires. He said by managing the threat caused to the fish in this way, the state government “was turning a national park into a farm so they can manage these horses which are essentially farm animals”. “There’s a whole suite of species and ecosystems, not just the stocky galaxias, which are left inside areas where they’re going to retain horses. “It means these species and ecosystems will continue to decline in the horse retention areas, which is not the way people expect a national park to be managed.” A spokesperson for the federal environment department said the environment minister, Sussan Ley, “has been advised about the plan and is aware of public commentary on it”. “Implementation arrangements are a matter for the NSW government,” the spokesperson said. “The minister will actively monitor the state’s implementation of the plan.” Comment was sought from the NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, whose office referred questions to the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment. A department spokesperson said the national parks and wildlife service was working with NSW fisheries to link ponds at a site in Eucumbene to “provide the best possible additional insurance habitat for the Tantangara galaxias”. The spokesperson said the draft plan received more than 4,000 submissions and all had been considered before adopting the final plan. “Stocky galaxias at Tantangara Creek are located in an area where wild horse densities will be reduced. The species will benefit from a substantial reduction (approximately 75%) in the density of wild horses,” the spokesperson said. “The plan provides for exclusion fencing where considered necessary to protect high value assets over the short to medium term while the wild horse population is reduced using other methods of control.”",

The species will benefit from a substantial reduction (approximately 75%) in the density of wild horses,” the spokesperson said.</p> \n<p>“The plan provides for exclusion fencing where considered necessary to protect high value assets over the short to medium term while the wild horse population is reduced using other methods of control.”<br></p>"
