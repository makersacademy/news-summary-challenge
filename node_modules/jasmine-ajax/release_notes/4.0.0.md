# Jasmine Ajax 4.0.0 Release Notes

## Summary
This release include a number of new features as well as a minor breaking change.

## Breaking Changes

* The callback for `andCallFunction` on a request stub, will now only receive the XHR request object as an argument. Previously, it received the stub itself first and the XHR object second. Given the way we expect this to have been used, the request is the more important.
* The `responseCallFunction` on the FakeRequest has also been removed.  If you were using that directly and not through the stub functionality, you should be able to replace it by calling your function directly and passing in the request.


## Changes

* `andCallFunction` on a request stub has more deterministic behavior across multiple calls. See breaking changes
