  "body": "<p>Naoki Higashida is a 24-year-old man with severe, largely non-verbal autism. Though he cannot hold a conversation, he uses an alphabet grid to build up sentences, which are taken down by a transcriber. By this method he produced his first book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/29/reason-jump-autism-naoki-higashida-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Reason I Jump</em></a>, when he was only 13. It quickly became an autism&#xa0;classic.</p> <p>My two eldest sons, George and Sam, have autism. Sam is the same age as Higashida, and similar in many ways. When I read <em>The Reason I Jump</em>, I felt as if Sam was speaking to me fully for the first time – or for the first time since early childhood, when he would try earnestly to make himself understood before withdrawing, defeated. Would reading its successor be as valuable and powerful an experience?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/feb/28/writing-about-autism-parents-are-sick-of-being-asked-what-special-skill-their-child-has\">Writing about autism: 'Parents are sick of being asked what special skill their child has'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The answer, overall, is yes. The new book lacks, perhaps, the startling novelty of its predecessor; the fresh originality of young adolescence has been replaced by the clear, gentle voice of a very nice and thoughtful young man. But there is much to be learned from it about this mysterious condition that Higashida regards as both a blessing and a curse.</p> <p>The book’s single most important function is to drum into the sometimes thick heads of us neurotypical readers that people with autism experience a genuine and usually insuperable disconnection between what they want to say or do and what their brain allows them. Higashida wants to laugh along with other people, to exchange greetings, to say “thank you”, but his mind “tends to go blank whenever I try to speak”. His brain “has this habit of getting lost inside things”; he blurts out remembered phrases as if hitting “a replay button I have no control&#xa0;over”.</p> <p>This lack of control is one of the most painful aspects of his autism. His mother asks him if he wants his gloves; “I replied ‘gloves’ straight off even though, in truth, I didn’t want the gloves.” Gloves was the last word he heard, and “latterly heard words stick best to my memory”. At worst, “when I fight the demands of my fixations, and when my urge to do what my fixation dictates and my determination to ignore it smash into each other, I can erupt into anger”. A meltdown follows: “I want to take control of the situation, but my brain won’t let me… My rage is directed at my brain, so… I start punching my own head.” Head-punching and other forms of self-harm are common autistic traits, much more so among the non-verbal. Higashida’s explanation makes perfect sense.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Spoken language is a blue sea. Everyone else is swimming, diving and frolicking, while I’m alone, stuck in a tiny boat</p> <footer> <cite>Naoki Higashida</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Autism prevents him from seeking help, and makes him unable to accept intervention, however well intentioned. “If I’m agitated… please let me work through it… nothing you say is going to get through to me. Please be calm and even-tempered even when I’m mid-meltdown, and don’t try to talk me out of it.” Reprimands delivered mid-meltdown are worse than useless, they can even become “tangled up with my anger” and create “a new verbal fixation. Your words will then stir me up even more.” Advice like this is of incalculable value to the bewildered parent, teacher or carer.</p> <p>Higashida has progressed since the days of <em>The Reason I Jump</em>. There are losses as well as gains: “I feel less connected to nature… however, I’ve grown fonder of myself.” As a child, he hated himself so much “that I didn’t want anyone else even to see me… I yearned to vanish from the&#xa0;world.”</p> <p>He used to run away, as did Sam. Calling out police helicopters was a regular event during Sam’s childhood. It never crossed my mind that self-hatred could be behind his disappearances; I wouldn’t have credited him with such a level of awareness, but Higashida’s writing opens my mind to all sorts of possibilities for interpreting the behaviour of both my sons.</p> <p>Life is still challenging, but Higashida no longer wants to vanish. “I only reached a place where I’m OK with being seen when I was able, finally, to accept my disability.” Perhaps achieving this acceptance explains why so many autistic people, George and Sam included, become much calmer and easier to live with as they get older. Higashida can’t imagine losing his autism, and doesn’t relish the as yet entirely theoretical idea of a “cure”; “How would you feel if you were obliged to undergo medical treatment for the sole reason that the person you are is an inconvenience? To live a life where I feel blessed to have autism: that will be my goal from now on.”</p> <p>As with <em>The Reason I Jump</em>, <em>Fall Down 7 Times Get Up 8</em> is translated by the novelist David Mitchell and his wife KA Yoshida, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/29/david-mitchell-my-sons-autism\" title=\"\">themselves parents of an autistic son</a>. Some readers will question its authenticity; how could such lucid prose, such a flexible vocabulary, be commanded by someone who cannot talk, and whose reading consists mainly of the picture books of his childhood? Moreover, a defining characteristic of autism is held to be lack of empathy, yet Higashida shows a delicate regard for the difficulties his condition creates – “I encroach upon other people’s comfort zones, yet I remain acutely sensitive about my own” – and is adept at explaining his experiences in language that makes sense to neurotypicals – “I try to ensure my autism-influenced senses don’t take my sentences too far from the reader’s experience”.</p> <p>Lacking any insider information, I choose to believe in it. We accept that some non-verbal autists can produce astonishingly intricate drawings or play classical music beautifully, so why should a facility for language not also be possible? Higashida points out that neurotypicals “say whatever comes into their heads, unfiltered” in front of autists, wrongly assuming that because they don’t react, they can’t understand or aren’t listening. Higashida has many years’ experience of nonreactive observation to draw on for his observations about human behaviour.</p> <p>Besides, there’s something gloriously autistic about Higashida’s writing. He isn’t a neurotypical trapped by wordlessness. His sensibility is “other”. His overwhelming reactions to a rusty umbrella fastening, sticking plasters, a cartoon kitten; his inability to interpret the sound of rain as meaning that it is actually raining; his limited awareness of the wider lives of the people he’s fond of – all this would be hard to fake.</p> <p>I don’t think that all non-verbals are as gifted as he is; parents shouldn’t feel tortured by their failure&#xa0;to release a hypothetical hidden talent. Rather, we should look&#xa0;with gratitude through the porthole he has cleared on to a submerged world: “Spoken language is a blue sea. Everyone else is swimming, diving and frolicking freely, while I’m alone, stuck in a tiny boat, swayed from side to side. Rushing towards me are waves of sound… When I’m working on my alphabet grid or my computer, I feel as if someone’s cast a magic spell and turned me into a dolphin.”</p> <p><em>• Fall Down 7 Times Get Up 8 </em>by Naoki Higashida is published by Sceptre (£14.99).

  "body": "<h2>The winner will be ...</h2> <p><strong>Costa Rica</strong>. The Gold Cup trophy shuttles between the US and Mexico. Yet … <em>Los Ticos</em> are in form and bring arguably the Gold Cup’s strongest squad; a talented midfield and one of the tightest defenses even without regular goalkeeper Keylor Navas. Likely to meet the US in the semi-finals, which could go either way; but if Costa Rica prevail an under-strength Mexico probably await. <strong>TD</strong></p> <p><strong>United States</strong>. The Americans and Mexico are Gold Cup co-favorites <em>in perpetua</em>, having combined to win 12 of the 13 tournaments held since the format was reorganized in 1991. World Cup quarter-finalists Costa Rica are a trendy choice and should offer the hosts a stiff test in the semi-finals at Arlington’s AT&amp;T Stadium, the 100,000-capacity home of the Dallas Cowboys. Yes, Bruce Arena has not called up a full-strength squad, but a US team including veterans Alejandro Bedoya, Matt Besler, Omar Gonzalez, Brad Guzan and Graham Zusi should be enough to see off a depleted <em>El Tri</em>, whose top players will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jul/02/portugal-mexico-confederations-cup-match-report\">be given a rest after the Confederations Cup</a>. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jul/03/bruce-arena-shows-that-many-of-usas-best-prospects-are-mls-based\">Bruce Arena shows that many of USA's best prospects are MLS based</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>United States. </strong>Let’s say USA, because in many ways this is the chance for Bruce Arena to assert his claim as the future of the team, and truly transcend the firefighter status he arrived in the job with. And after the succession of tournament failures at Olympic, Gold Cup and playoff levels during this World Cup cycle, the US just seem to need that bounce going into 2018 more than their most credible rivals. Mexico’s the best team right now, but they have other priorities. <strong>GP</strong></p> <p><strong>United States</strong>. History suggests that this is a two-team race, with the US and Mexico having split all but one-ever Gold Cup title between them. With the Mexicans focusing their summer efforts on last month’s Confederations Cup, and despite sporting a weakened roster of its own, the USMNT is the team to beat. <strong>MP</strong></p> <h2>Bruce Arena’s US reign so far is ...</h2> <p>Sensible and solid, unbeaten in eight games, if a touch over-praised simply by virtue of Arena not being Jürgen Klinsmann. A poor 2015 tournament dented Klinsmann’s reputation, but Arena’s recent appointment and a roster of fringe players largely relieves him of any pressure to win this iteration, though the US will still be expected to reach the final. <strong>TD</strong></p> <p>The US team’s road to Russia is far from complete with return matches against Costa Rica and Honduras looming in September, but Arena has restored the side’s trademark fighting spirit in pulling their qualifying hopes back from the brink. This was evident after the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/11/usa-mexico-michael-bradley-world-cup-qualifier-2018\">secured a rare point at Mexico’s Estadio Azteca</a>, when several players hailed the veteran coach’s meticulous preparation and forthright communication with the team – and not without thinly veiled shots at Klinsmann. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>Solid. The Honduras win was so emphatic it would have been easy to get carried away, but the first half of the Trinidad and Tobago qualifier and the large sections of time on the backfoot in the Azteca game showed some of the limitations of this group. But Arena puts players in positions they understand, doesn’t tinker unnecessarily, and ensures that the US at least punch at their weight. And he’s been gifted with the emergence of Christian Pulisic. <strong>GP</strong><br></p> <p>Going about as swimmingly as the federation could have imagined. Under the veteran coach’s tutelage, the Americans are back on track for qualification to Russia 2018 and enter the Gold Cup on a good run of form. The vibe around the team, too, has significantly brightened in 2017. Maybe this will teach US Soccer an overdue lesson about keeping coaches in charge for more than one World Cup cycle. <strong>MP</strong></p> <h2>Player to watch </h2> <p><strong>Kellyn Acosta</strong>.<strong> </strong>There’s intrigue as to whether the 21-year-old FC Dallas midfielder can play himself into a sure starting role for September’s World Cup qualifiers ahead of the 35-year-old Jermaine Jones. A starter in June’s 1-1 tie with Mexico, he’s the most likely outfield candidate on the 23-man roster to feature prominently if the US reaches Russia 2018. <strong>TD</strong></p> <p><strong>Juan Agudelo</strong>. The 24-year-old striker, once one of the US team’s brightest prospects, has been floated as a potential candidate for the fourth forward spot on the World Cup roster. Arena will lean heavily on him for scoring punch against a gaggle of group-stage opponents the US team is supposed to beat. It’s a golden opportunity for the Colombian-born forward to earn his ticket. <strong>BAG</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Dom Dwyer</strong> will be an interesting case study. His citizenship came at just the right time to give him not just a realistic shot at making the World Cup roster for the US, but perhaps the perfect time for him to time his run into the roster as one of those players who seems to emerge in every cycle from fringe contention to playing a key role, before their novelty wears off. That said, a strong showing in the group stages won’t prove he’s the solution – remember Chris Wondolowski scoring goals for fun at the same stage? <strong>GP</strong></p> <p><strong>Erick ‘Cubo’ Torres</strong>. The 24-year-old Mexican forward was a late roster addition, having missed the initial cut and has his chance in place of the injured Alan Pulido. As has been typical in front of his season, expect Torres to make the most of his chance. Torres is currently in second place in MLS with 12 goals, and he’s playing as well as he has since the last time he got a serious look from <em>El Tri</em> in 2015. <strong>MP</strong></p> <h2>Surprise team of the tournament</h2> <p><strong>French Guiana. </strong>As Gold Cup debutants their presence is inherently unexpected, and with a handful of Ligue 1 players they could cause Canada some stress on Friday in Group A’s opener. <strong>TD</strong></p> <p><strong>Curaçao</strong>. Remember: only four of the 12 teams in the field are eliminated after the group stage so the likelihood of an unknown making the last eight is always high. Whether they can go further, like when tiny Guadeloupe surprised Honduras in the quarters a decade ago, is less likely. But don’t sleep on Curaçao, who won 2-1 over Jamaica in the Caribbean Cup final last month on a brace by Elson Hooi, who can prove a handful in the midfield. Cuco Martina (Southampton) and Leandro Bacuna (Aston Villa) lend Premier League experience to the back four. In a top-heavy group in which Mexico appear the only sure thing, the tiny island nation is a live dog. <strong>BAG</strong><br></p> <p>Is it a cop out to say <strong>Costa Rica</strong>? The Ticos burst onto the world stage at the last World Cup, and are hardly an unknown quantity, but with Mexico’s main group focusing on the Confederations Cup, the team that saw off Jürgen Klinsmann as US coach may feel this is their best chance of a strong showing at the Gold Cup in a long time. <strong>GP</strong></p> <p><strong>Honduras</strong>. Honduras have never reached the final of this version of the continental championship, but blessed with a kind draw and with attacking talent in spades, <em>Los Catrachos</em> could make a deep run. Houston Dynamo team-mates Alberth Elis and Romell Quioto are a nightmare for opposing defenses. <strong>MP</strong></p> <h2>The Gold Cup matters because ... </h2> <p>It’s a chance for understudies to make their case for a role on bigger stages, and while always hosting it in the US every two years breeds ennui, there’s novelty value in seeing the likes of Martinique and French Guiana, who aren’t even members of Fifa. And it’s July and there’s not much else going on. <strong>TD</strong></p> <p>Funny event, this. It’s a chance for local heavyweights to fine-tune and give meaningful reps to fringe players (and inch closer to a Confederations Cup berth), while it essentially represents the pinnacle for overseas departments like French Guiana and Martinique, who as non-members of Fifa are ineligible to qualify for other major international tournaments. For everyone in the middle, most notably Costa Rica, Honduras and Panama, it’s a crucial opportunity to tinker ahead of the matches that will determine their World Cup fates. There’s thousands of miles of travel and triple-digit temperatures and it’s mostly a circus playing out on the marginalia of the US sports conversation. But it’s always fun. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>As MLS grows in importance and brings in more players from the region, the Gold Cup has had a little more edge in recent years in terms of showcasing players, so there’s a domestic as well as international level to consider. At international level, there’s no doubting the centenary edition of the Copa América showed the limits of the Gold Cup as a marketable and competitive force, so it’s long-term viability as a biennial contest may be in question. But for now it’s still a key part of setting the World Cup cycle development pace for the region’s heavy hitters. <strong>GP</strong></p> <p>The opportunity it grants teams like Martinique and Curaçao. This is as grand a stage as the region’s minnows can reasonably reach, and it is invaluable for the development of the sport in those regions. <strong>MP</strong></p> <h2>Semi-finals </h2> <p>United States v Costa Rica, Mexico v Honduras <strong>TD</strong></p> <p>United States v Curaçao, Mexico v Costa Rica <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>United States v Panama, Costa Rica v Mexico <strong>GP</strong><br></p> <p>United States v Costa Rica, Mexico v Honduras <strong>MP</strong></p> <h2>Final</h2> <p>Costa Rica v Mexico <strong>TD</strong></p> <p>United States v Costa Rica <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>United States v Costa Rica <strong>GP</strong></p> <p>United States v Mexico <strong>MP</strong></p> <ul> <li>This article was updated on 7 July to reflect <a href=\"https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2017/07/06/florent-malouda-french-guiana-gold-cup-france-concacaf-fifa?utm_campaign=si-soccer&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;xid=socialflow_twitter_si\">Concacaf’s decision</a> to rule Flourent Malouda ineligible to appear for French Guiana.</li> </ul> <p><strong><br></strong></p>"
