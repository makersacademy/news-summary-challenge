        _summary: "The vice-chancellor of Sussex University is reported to have received a £230,000 “golden handshake” when he left the institution in August last year, the latest revelation in a week of controversy about excessive payoffs and rising salaries for higher education chiefs. It was reported this week that Bath Spa University paid Christina Slade £808,000 in her final year as vice-chancellor before she was appointed emeritus professor in what is thought to be the highest payment made in the sector to date. Dame Glynis Breakwell, the vice-chancellor of nearby Bath University, stepped down last week after an outcry over her £468,000 pay package, Southampton University was forced to defend paying its vice-chancellor £423,000, and academics at Birmingham University protested against the £2.9m paid its vice-chancellor, Sir David Eastwood. In the House of Lords, where he sits as a non-affiliated peer, he said: “Our universities are wracked by controversy over sky-high student fees and debts, run by vice-chancellors who have become latter day prince bishops paid up to £500,000 a year, and likening themselves to [Diego] Maradona and Richard Branson. He said excessive pay for university heads would be brought under control by new regulations next year.",

        _summary: "Boris Johnson has arrived in Tehran, where he is expected to lobby for the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman who has been imprisoned there for nearly two years. Johnson will also meet President Hassan Rouhani, Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran’s supreme national security council, and other officials, the state news agency IRNA said on Saturday. The visit will be Johnson’s first to the country and only the third by a British foreign minister to Iran in the last 14 years. Johnson has denied these additional charges are due to his error in telling a foreign affairs select committee in November that she had been in Iran to train  was arrested at Tehran airport in April 2016 with her young daughter, a British national, and accused of attempting to orchestrate a “soft overthrow” of the Islamic republic. Johnson has since apologised for the mistake and recently met her British husband, Richard Ratcliffe, who said he was “waiting on tenterhooks and biting his nails” about the foreign secretary’s visit.",

        _summary: "Sandy Hook has become synonymous with a cynicism about America’s escalating gun violence problem; if Americans could not pass stricter gun laws after 20 children were shot dead in their elementary school classrooms, then they would never act. After a mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, a White House spokeswoman emphasize the importance of not passing gun control laws. Those protesting the NRA’s attempt to eviscerate local gun control laws included gun violence survivors from Chicago, the sister of the school psychologist killed at Sandy Hook, family members of people who had used guns to kill themselves, and women who had escaped domestic violence. Tiffany Starr, who had come to Washington from New Jersey for her first day of gun violence prevention advocacy, had tried to sway a vote on the NRA-backed bill. Starr and a group of other survivors had gone through several Capitol metal detectors and into the gallery overlooking the House floor to watch the vote on the NRA bill.",

Alexie’s mother was Spokane while his father was a member of the Coeur d’Alene tribe. “My mother and father were members of the first generation of Interior Salish people who lived entirely without wild salmon. My mother and father, without wild salmon, were spiritual orphans.” Alexie’s father drank himself to death, but his mother stopped drinking when Alexie was a boy.",

        _summary: "In Sunday Feature: Laura Ingalls Wilder (10 December, 6.45pm, Radio 3) Samira Ahmed travels to the Missouri home of the pioneer-girl author who gave us the books from which sprang Little House on the Prairie. Since hearing Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine (Weekdays, 10.45pm, Radio 4) I’ve learned the Gail Honeyman book this quirky story comes from is a bestseller. In this version, Tracy Wiles relates the routine of the young woman who works in Accounts Payable, wears the same clothes to work every day, plots a fuddled path through her lonely weekends with the help of two bottles of vodka, living out a life of quiet desperation until exposure to a local singer brings her into unexpected contact with the world of intimate waxing and thrusts her towards the madness that is normal life for her workmates. This entire Saturday morning is given over to Great Lives: Four Hundred and Counting (9 December, 9am, Radio 4 Extra). Thinking Outside the Boxset: How Technology Changed the Story (Thursdays, 11.30am, Radio 4) is an overdue look at how the new ways in which TV and film are distributed in these binge-watching days makes their creators rethink narrative.",

        _summary: "Pep Guardiola’s transformation of Manchester City this season was sparked by his own shock at failing to master the Premier League in his debut campaign. On Sunday at Old Trafford City have the chance to equal the Premier League’s record winning run of 14 games by beating their derby rivals Manchester United. Stones was in the side that claimed a 1-0 victory in September at Chelsea, perhaps the result of Guardiola’s City tenure so far, as it came away to champions and in the wake of Sergio Agüero’s car crash in Amsterdam and Benjamin Mendy’s serious knee injury. While Stones talks of the manager importing his message in a few words, De Bruyne has spoken privately of how Guardiola can be a distant figure, speaking to him only when necessary – but it counting when he does. Wednesday night’s reverse at Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League was the first in 227 days in any competition and would surely have been avoided had Guardiola not fielded a makeshift side so as to rest players for Sunday’s derby, a match that may well decide the title.",

        _summary: "Emma Hayes and Nick Cushing could have spent Sunday on tenterhooks, each waiting to learn if they had impressed Football Association officials sufficiently to be named as England’s new manager next week. Cushing appeared the more conflicted of the two, City’s coach withdrawing from an FA shortlist also believed to include Canada’s Consett-born coach John Herdman and England’s caretaker, Mo Marley, only a week ago. It leaves him free to extend an intriguing duel with Hayes as City arrive at Kingsmeadow two points clear of Chelsea at the top of the WSL. Foremost among those subplots is Eni Aluko’s possible reunion with a cadre of City players who were once her England team-mates but are no longer on speaking terms with the Chelsea striker. Any cameos featuring Aluko and Jill Scott, the City and England midfielder, will be interesting.",

        _summary: "A national railcard for millennials was launched this week, promising one-third off fares for 26- to 30-year-olds. On Twitter, Railcard responded to one potential user, by saying: “Railcards were introduced to encourage certain groups to travel during off-peak times, to essentially promote rail travel during less busy times. The new railcard is to be launched in a staged way, with the first 10,000 being made available to those living in areas serviced by Greater Anglia, covering 213 postcodes. Some regular train users say it could save them hundreds of pounds a year; the BBC cited one case of a 30-year-old following his football team to matches around the country, where using the card would save him up to £400 a year. The 3.4% increase in rail fares for 2018, confirmed this week, is another disheartening announcement for all commuters who are facing higher travel costs at a time when wages are rising by only around 2%.",

With Fox News and News Corp, Murdoch will continue to have the ear of the political elites in the US, UK and Australia, but with less of the hassle of competing in fields that are increasingly dominated by the tech companies he fears and dislikes. On Friday, the Financial Times reported that James Murdoch, who as 21st Century Fox chief executive will have the business he runs broken up if the mooted deal comes off, is expected to part company with his father, either by joining Disney or launching his own venture. For one, during the phone hacking scandal that rocked Murdoch’s UK newspaper businesses, he “repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of him as a chief executive officer and chairman”, according to the UK media regulator, Ofcom. But for Rupert Murdoch, the chance to roll the dice one more time, bank billions, build his news business, end a family squabble and potentially position his son to run the world’s biggest media combine may be too good to miss.",
