Why would I leave my job? Itâ€™s everyone else who has left.â€</p> <p>Channel 4 will air the highly anticipated first episode of the The Great British Bake Off on 29 August. With 14 million viewers watching its most recent final, the showâ€™s relocation prompted a backlash from fans and members of the cast.</p> <p>Presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc cut ties with the show, as did Hollywoodâ€™s co-judge and national treasure, Mary Berry, who is returning to her role as a judge on a new BBC cooking programme. In their place, Channel 4 has brought on Prue Leith as a judge and Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig as presenters. <br /></p> <p>The programme is still based at Welford Park, the country house and private estate, famous for its display of snowdrops, and once used by King Henry VIII as his personal hunting lodge. Welford Park has been the site of the Bake Off tent for the past four years. But for the first time, producers have opened the doors to newspaper journalists, who have the opportunity to have their baking critiqued by Hollywood and Leith.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6634b4a82f3d7945f4754601d580aefac49944b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6634b4a82f3d7945f4754601d580aefac49944b/0_73_3261_2260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Hollywood, Nadia Khomami and Prue Leith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nadia proudly displays her handiwork to Paul and Prue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Bourdillon/Channel 4 Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cabbie who drove me to the site from Newbury told me he was strictly forbidden from talking about the show, and that all the taxi drivers who took people to the location had to sign a contract. â€œI find it quite amusing,â€ he said, joking that I would probably have to produce my fingerprints on arrival.</p> <p>While I didnâ€™t have to do that, I was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement and refrain from taking any pictures or tweeting about the day. The machinations of Bake Off, it appears, are as classified as those of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/16/area-51-cia-ufos-aliens-nevada\">Area 51</a>, and one producer quipped that whenever she brings family and friends to the set, it feels â€œa bit like theyâ€™ve won the golden ticket to see Willy Wonkaâ€.</p> <p>With this air of mystery, can viewers expect a different show to the one they have grown accustomed to? â€œWeâ€™ve got different hosts and a different judge, thatâ€™s the only difference,â€ Hollywood says. â€œThe feel of the show is exactly the same as itâ€™s always been.</p> <p>â€œOnce people watch it theyâ€™ll understand that the format is what itâ€™s all about. The main picture has always been the bakers, and the standard has been borderline professional this year.â€</p> <p>â€œI really think if you give it one minuteâ€™s thought,â€ Leith says, â€œChannel 4 paid a lot of money for a product: theyâ€™re not then going to change that product, theyâ€™re buying what was hugely successful.â€</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"965760eafe2e16a7f48bc249fc77aba0298eb979\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/965760eafe2e16a7f48bc249fc77aba0298eb979/0_0_2333_3500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Khomamiâ€™s brownies.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khomamiâ€™s brownies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Bourdillon/Channel 4 Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last month, Channel 4 boss, Jay Hunt, suggested the new series would be given a â€œmodernâ€ revamp, and Fielding and Toksvig are expected to help deliver this. â€œI think if you put Noel Fielding into a show, heâ€™s going to make it a bit cool,â€ Leith says.</p> <p>â€œModernisation is probably the wrong word,â€ Hollywood says. â€œThereâ€™s a change in dynamics with Noel and Sandy, because theyâ€™re not Mel and Sue, who have been together for 150 years or something. Noel and Sandyâ€™s comedy is different to theirs. But itâ€™s really funny, and together itâ€™s hilarious because itâ€™s so starkly different.â€</p> <p>And do Hollywood and Leith share a chemistry and sense of humour? â€œIt feels like Iâ€™ve been working with Prue for years. She reminds me of my mother-in-law, in a good way,â€ he says. â€œWe met at one of the tests, and as soon as we started chatting, in my head I went, â€˜yep, thatâ€™s itâ€™.â€</p> <p>â€œWe both laugh at the same things, but Paul is wicked,â€ Prue says. â€œI mean, he is absolutely wicked. When I was really nervous on the very first day, I walked into the tent, and we had to learn the names of 12 people weâ€™d never clapped eyes on. I couldnâ€™t remember one contestantâ€™s name. I asked Paul, â€˜thatâ€™s Harry, isnâ€™t it?â€™ He said, â€˜no, thatâ€™s Tom.â€™ So I said, â€˜Tom, tell us about your signature bake,â€™ and everyone laughed. Cut. He was lying and landed me bang in it. I thought, â€˜okay, Iâ€™ve got your measure.â€™â€</p> <p>Though she was brought on to replace Berry, Leith, cool and collected, explains she feels no pressure about having to step into her predecessorâ€™s shoes. </p> <p>â€œIâ€™m not trying to be Mary. She stood there, tasted the cakes, said what she thought about it â€“ I do exactly the same. Itâ€™s just that I have a different personality â€¦ Presumably they hired me because they think I can do the job. Iâ€™m doing the job, Iâ€™m enjoying it â€“ I donâ€™t feel itâ€™s going wrong.â€</p> <p>While praising the â€œstrongest charactersâ€ in the showâ€™s history, the judges refuse to pick a favourite, claiming the only thing that will impress them is whatâ€™s on the plate. â€œWe wonâ€™t remember your face but weâ€™ll remember your brownies,â€ Leith says in a further vote of confidence. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2017/aug/03/great-british-bake-off-trailer-released-channel-4-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/7x4mh\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3743297\"            data-video-name=\"Great British Bake Off trailer released by Channel 4 â€“ video\"            data-video-provider=\"Channel 4\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-59832981e4b0fc7cd529ce02\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/08/03/170803GBBO2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/08/03/170803GBBO2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/08/03/170803GBBO2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2017/aug/03/great-british-bake-off-trailer-released-channel-4-video\">Great British Bake Off trailer released by Channel 4</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Past contestants, she says, â€œall hugely admire Paul, and Iâ€™ve noticed that some of them will still text him if they need help or advice.â€</p> <p>â€œWhat?

Prue is making out like the bakers here text me: itâ€™s certainly not every day.â€</p> <p>So no WhatsApp thread? â€œNo,â€ he says. â€œI donâ€™t message them going, â€˜hi guys, how are you getting on today, you winners?â€™â€</p> <p>Leith comes to the rescue. â€œWhat I meant is Paul has this exterior of being tough as old boots, but ask him for some help and heâ€™ll give it to you,â€ she says. â€œI am sure there are past bakers who feel that their career has been helped by him.â€</p> <p>Unfortunately, it seems there wonâ€™t be any help for my baking career. Even though I make my excuses â€“ â€œIâ€™ve only baked twice beforeâ€ and â€œit was short noticeâ€ â€“ Hollywood is having none of it. The only sage words of advice are that they could always use me on set as a handyman and my brownies as bricks.</p>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/9406cfe0e55208d82c4aa7ff4aae159249517e91/0_253_3500_2101/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false},

The breeding season has petered out, and by and large the birds have retired from public life: to moult, to regrow, to regroup. Itâ€™s a drab, warm morning. One of the kingfishers hunches over the streaming shallows. A young bullfinch mopes in the low branches of an ash. Damp late-summer greenery â€“ ferns, goosegrass, <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/rosebay-willowherb\">rosebay willowherb</a> â€“ chokes the pathways.<strong><br /></strong></p> <p>Here and there, in the riverside woodland, the warden has laid down boards of planking for young adventurers to peer beneath. Typically thereâ€™ll be worms and snails, sage-green slugs and hectic centipedes, perhaps a <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/wood-mouse\">wood mouse</a>â€™s midden of neatly nibbled cherry pits. </p> <p>I lever up one of the boards. A black ground beetle skitters away in panicky zig-zags. There are two lizards, young ones, siblings, I suppose â€“ theyâ€™ll be <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/common-lizard\">common lizards, <em>Zootoca vivipara</em></a>. They stir torpidly, but donâ€™t run off. As they grow theyâ€™ll become longer, sleeker, more snake-like, but now, as juveniles, they have a flat look, and hold their bodies in a gecko-ish kink.<br /></p> <p>They might be siblings but they are strikingly different. One has the classic common lizard colouration: a yellowish buff, with brown go-faster stripes running parallel to the backbone. The other is all drama. Itâ€™s grey, charcoal-grey, panther-grey, all over, as if spraypainted. Pigmentation can vary widely in common lizards but this sort of melanism is, I think, fairly rare.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"464809c3cf8289b83c43a8b9b2c66627949f422a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/464809c3cf8289b83c43a8b9b2c66627949f422a/0_0_5120_3413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Common frog (Rana temporaria)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A common frog <em>(Rana temporaria</em>) at the lighter end of the colour spectrum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Grady/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under another board, I meet a frog. Itâ€™s a big one, so probably female. She, too, is darkly pigmented. The frogs I know from home (they cluster in the damp of our houseâ€™s light well) are a glossy pale olive colour. This one is far darker, something like the green of card-table baize. Itâ€™s a common point of difference in frogs: they can range from yellow to orange-red to almost black. She lopes off into the grass before I can replace the board. Thereâ€™s still at least a couple of months to go before she can dig herself into the mud and begin hibernation. There are herons here, and mink, and crows. Sheâ€™s done well to make it this far. </p> <p> </p>","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/330427a038d315fbb40cd28ff55d7dad18cb7fd8/0_262_3116_1870/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false}
