In short, Norwich are very nearly there, almost over the line. Victories at this stage of the season are not a given however: just ask Marcelo Bielsa. Steve Bruce was all but resigned to Wednesday’s season being over after defeat to Leeds last weekend and, if they are beaten at Carrow Road, then the play-offs will almost certainly be beyond them, even if not mathematically. In terms of team news, Emil Buendia serves the final game of a three-match suspension, while Jordan Rhodes is ineligible to face his parent club.

          trailText: "Police seize Extinction Rebellion boat as organisers plan to extend London action",
          body: '<p>Extinction Rebellion activists reported an influx of supporters on Friday, as the Easter holiday, balmy weather and promises of support from school strike leader Greta Thunberg injected new momentum into the weeklong climate protest.</p> <p>Despite more than 100 arrests on Friday, taking the total to 682 by early evening, the demonstration which has blocked four major London landmarks looked set to continue beyond the weekend, with organisers preparing to extend their disruption on Monday to “picnics on the motorway.”</p> <p>Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist and founder of the school strikes for climate movement, will visit parliament on Monday and Tuesday and told the Guardian she was also keen to join the campaigners on the streets.</p> <p>There were new waves of detentions elsewhere on Friday as police spent most of the afternoon trying to clear Oxford Circus junction of hundreds of activists and a pink boat named <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/berta-caceres">Berta Cáceres</a> after the murdered Honduran environmental activist. Officers with angle grinders cut through the bars below the hull, which activists had chained and glued themselves to.</p> <p>The sympathetic crowd clapped and roared in support of each of the people removed. “Nothing else worked,” said one of them as he was dragged away by four officers. “Come and join us.”</p> <p>On Thursday night the police had demanded the activists remove the boat, saying it was a safety hazard, citing risks to public safety if it continued as a impromptu party venue over the bank holiday weekend. </p> <p>Late on Friday afternoon police managed to remove protesters who were glued to the boat and dismantle the sound system that had been installed. As police tried to remove the boat from the junction, protesters blocked side roads, attempting to thwart them, leading to a stalemate. In the evening, as the pink vessel was finally loaded into the back of a truck and driven away, the crowd chanted “We have more boats” and “We will not be moved.”</p> <p>The Metropolitan police has admitted it is overstretched and officers said additional forces were called in from Wales and other regions to prevent Heathrow from becoming a target, but fears proved exaggerated. A group of 15 youth activists staged a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/19/extinction-rebellion-stages-youth-protest-at-heathrow-airport">two-hour peaceful protest</a> at a road junction close to the airport.</p> <p>At the biggest of the camps at Marble Arch, organisers said they had about 300 signups in the afternoon alone, with dozens of people volunteering to work as brochure distributors. Wolfgang Wopperer-Beholz, who manned the sign-up desk, said there had been a marked increase compared with the previous day. “Earlier, the people who put their names on the list were already knowledgeable. Now we are seeing more people who don’t know so much, but are pretty enthusiastic.” He said many had mentioned the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/18/climate-change-the-facts-review-our-greatest-threat-laid-bare-david-attenborough">David Attenborough </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/18/climate-change-the-facts-review-our-greatest-threat-laid-bare-david-attenborough">documentary</a> on climate change that had aired on the BBC on Thursday night.</p> <p>Induction sessions at a tent in Parliament Square were so packed that the attendees spilled outside. “It’s growing at an amazing rate. I think the Attenborough documentary lit a fire in people’s bellies,” said one of the activists, who gave only the name Archer. “They are not just the usual dirty hippies either. There are doctors, architects, and the ethnic diversity is getting wider.”</p> <p>“I’ve campaigned on this for 30 years with very little effect. It’s only with Extinction Rebellion that I have a sense that we are getting somewhere,” said Bing Jones, a retired doctor from Sheffield, who was arrested and placed in a police cell in Belgravia on Thursday night. “When I was released, there was a volunteer waiting for me outside with a Mars bar and big smile. He had signed up that day, been trained and then sat outside the police station for four hours until I came out. This is a wonderful, strange movement and new people continue to come along.”</p> <p>Among the newcomers on Friday was actor Sonera Angel, who was waving a yellow banner marked with the Extinction Rebellion symbol near the police perimeter at Oxford Circus. She said she had come by train with a big group from Southend. She planned to return over the weekend and persuade more of her friends to join. “There is no excuse now it is a holiday,” she said. “Climate change is such a huge issue and governments all over the world are doing almost nothing about it.”</p> <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="648beca3d95b61c99655fc265bc4b0f4891a9a1a"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/648beca3d95b61c99655fc265bc4b0f4891a9a1a/325_350_5143_3086/1000.jpg" alt="Emma Thompson on the Berta Cáceres boat at Oxford Circus" width="1000" height="600" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Emma Thompson on the Berta Cáceres boat at Oxford Circus.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <p>The actor Emma Thompson also joined the Oxford Circus camp on Friday morning as activists read “poems to the Earth”. Later she gave a speech from the Berta Cáceres boat.</p> <p>Thompson said her generation had failed young people: “We have seriously failed them and our planet is in serious trouble, we have much, much less time than we thought. I have seen the evidence for myself and I really care about my children and grandchildren enough to want to be here today to stand with the next generation.”</p> <p>Organisers say the protests will continue for another week, bolstered by Thunberg, who will arrive in the UK on Sunday as part of a European tour that has included a meeting with Pope Francis and an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2019/apr/16/greta-thunbergs-emotional-speech-to-eu-leaders-video">excoriating address at the European parliament</a>.</p> <p>Thunberg, whose strike sparked a global movement of more than a million students in less than a year, was also one of the signatories of the declaration that launched Extinction Rebellion in October. She had previously arranged to be in London after Easter to speak in parliament to party leaders and other MPs, meet fellow student activists and talk at a public event co-hosted by the Guardian.</p> <p>“I would love to participate in their protests while in London if there is time and if they are still protesting,” Thunberg said. “I think it’s one of the most important and hopeful movements of our time. Civil disobedience is necessary to create attention to the ongoing climate and ecological crisis.”</p> <p>Activists and politicians say she, and other young campaigners, had a key role to play. “She is abso-bloody-lutely important. I thank her from my heart,” said Ronan McNern, a spokesman for the group. “It’s not Extinction Rebellion that people should watch out for. It’s the school strike for climate, it’s the youth. This is their moment.”</p> <p>The climate campaigners have also been boosted by a host of prominent supporters from the science and academic communities as well as the entertainment world. <a href="https://planb.earth/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hansen-letter-updated.pdf">In an open letter on Friday</a>, the former Nasa scientist James Hansen spelled out the growing dangers of climate change and noted that he too has conducted “highly respectful acts of nonviolent civil disobedience – on occasion leading even to my arrest”.</p> <p>Linguist and activist Noam Chomsky is among those who have sent a statement of support. “It is impossible to exaggerate the awesome nature of the challenge we face: to determine, within the next few years, whether organised human society can survive in anything like its present form,” he said. “The activists of Extinction Rebellion are leading the way in confronting this immense challenge, with courage and integrity, an achievement of historic significance that must be amplified with urgency.”</p>',

          trailText: "Polls suggest comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy is due to score an overwhelming victory in Sunday’s vote",
          body: '<p>A noisy, boisterous standoff in a cavernous stadium. A police cordon separating the two rival fan sections, rock music pumping and insults flying. It had the feeling of a boxing grudge match, but instead it was the final act of Ukraine’s chaotic, unpredictable <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/18/ukraine-elections-actor-and-comedian-volodymyr-zelenskiy-poised-to-win-crushing-victory">election campaign</a>.</p> <p>Polls suggest that despite a complete lack of political experience, the 41-year-old comedian and actor Volodymyr Zelenskiy is due to score an overwhelming victory over the incumbent, Petro Poroshenko, in Sunday’s vote.</p> <p>Friday’s debate was seen as Poroshenko’s last chance to turn the tide and prove to the country that even if they were disappointed in his first term, sticking with him was a safer option than putting the country into the hands of a political novice.</p> <p>The debate had been the main subject of conversation in Ukraine all week, and was broadcast live on several television channels. Police said 22,000 people came to Kyiv’s Olympic Stadium to listen.</p> <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="0ea4cef86e30ffac7d99814f6096f9f70fca515a"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/0ea4cef86e30ffac7d99814f6096f9f70fca515a/0_72_3500_2100/1000.jpg" alt="Ukraine’s presidential candidates debate in Kiev." width="1000" height="600" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Ukraine’s presidential candidates debate in Kiev.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Vasily Fedosenko/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> <p>In the end, it was more of a shouting match than a debate. Poroshenko accused Zelenskiy of being a draft dodger, a political neophyte and dangerously pro-Russia. Zelenskiy shot back by reading a series of questions apparently sent in by ordinary Ukrainians, including “How do you sleep at night?” and “Why is Ukraine so poor when it has the richest president in its history?”</p> <p>Poroshenko won the presidency in 2014 shortly after the Maidan revolution <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/ukraine-tymoshenko-president-protests">swept former president Viktor Yanukovych from power</a>. As the army fought a war with Russia-backed forces in the east of the country that has now cost over 13,000 lives, the economy tanked and corruption flourished.</p> <p>Many voters are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/19/a-referendum-on-poroshenko-very-ukrainian-election">disappointed </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/19/a-referendum-on-poroshenko-very-ukrainian-election">by the lack of progress</a> and are ready to vote for Zelenskiy despite his lack of a programme, in the hope he might shake up the system.</p> <p>Zelenskiy has no political experience except playing a fictional president on screen, but despite giving little away about concrete policy positions, he won the first round three weeks ago with 30% of the vote, compared with 16% for Poroshenko. Since then a series of polls have suggested he is on course for an overwhelming victory in the run-off.</p> <p>“I’m not a politician. I’m a simple human who came to break the system,” he bellowed into the microphone, his voice bouncing the stadium to rival choruses of cheers and boos. “I am the result of your mistakes,” he told Poroshenko.</p> <p>Zelenskiy has run an unorthodox campaign consisting of stand-up comedy gigs, Instagram videos and quips, and had eschewed direct debate until the stadium event.</p> <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="031868f8afe09c64d59616014f0ce12d9f53d92e"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/031868f8afe09c64d59616014f0ce12d9f53d92e/0_4_3474_2084/1000.jpg" alt="Ukraine’s presidential candidates debate in Kiev" width="1000" height="600" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">‘Putin is dreaming of a weak and ill-prepared novice,’ Poroshenko tells the crowd.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Sergei Grits/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> <p>“He hides from journalists, from his opponents and from the Ukrainian people. Finally we can find out what exactly he plans to do,” said Poroshenko, his voice visibly emotional.</p> <p>It was Zelenskiy’s idea to hold the stadium debate in the first place, laying down a video challenge to Poroshenko he expected the president to turn down, saying he would only take part in a debate if it took part in the Olympic Stadium and both candidates took a drugs test. Realising he had little to lose, Poroshenko agreed, inviting the cameras to film him giving blood, urine and hair samples earlier in the month.</p> <p>After a long wrangle over the format, the decision was taken to have two separate stages at each end of the football pitch. Poroshenko subverted the format before the debate had even started, strutting the length of the pitch down the touchline and emerging on stage with Zelenskiy.</p> <p>Zelenskiy’s half of the stadium was sparsely filled, reinforcing the feeling that his stellar polling figures are less a reflection of fanatical support for his candidacy, but instead represent a general dissatisfaction with Poroshenko and the political elite.</p> <p>“By no means do we think that our opponent is a Kremlin agent, but Putin is dreaming of a weak and ill-prepared novice,” Poroshenko said, reinforcing his campaign message that Zelenskiy is a threat to national security. In response, Zelenskiy criticised Poroshenko for conducting business in Russia.</p> <p>There was little discussion of concrete policies, and it did not seem that Poroshenko landed the kind of knock-out blow he needed to turn around the polls. After the debate finished, he walked down the touchline again waving goodbye to his supporters, and it may well be that he was waving goodbye to the presidency as well.</p> <p>Barring a dramatic last-minute turnaround, Ukraine is heading for an uncertain new era under a mysterious new president.</p>',

          body: '<p>The last time Saracens won the European Champions Cup, in 2017, they defeated Glasgow in the quarter-finals and Munster in the last four to set up a date with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/13/clermont-auvergne-saracens-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report" title="">Clermont Auvergne in Edinburgh</a>.</p> <p>Glasgow were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/30/saracens-glasgow-champions-cup-match-report" title="">seen off last month</a> and Munster again stand in the way of another trip north, although not quite as far with the final being staged next month in Newcastle. It is the Irish province’s third consecutive semi-final and a record 14th in the competition but they have lost their past six since winning the tournament in 2008.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/19/brad-barritt-saracens-munster-champions-cup-semi-final-interview">Brad Barritt: ‘I had to be selfish and tell my three-year-old son to fill the ice machine’</a> </p> </aside> <p>“This stage has been a sticking point for us and that has to stop,” said Munster’s Ireland centre, Chris Farrell, who held talks with Saracens two years ago before deciding to leave Grenoble for Ireland. “We have to get beyond this point and we cannot have the same mindset as in previous years: we have to do something different.</p> <p>“Two years ago, we paid Saracens too much respect. We are not going to sit back and let them enforce their game as we did then. We cracked in the second half and did not look like we could trouble them but we are different now and have added a lot to our team.</p> <p>“They are the No 1 team in Europe and will be expecting to win but we will not make it easy for them. We have to put them under pressure early and stop them from generating momentum. This is our chance to start from zero.”</p> <p>It will be the ninth meeting of the sides in the tournament. Munster have five victories to three, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/apr/27/heinekencup.munster" title="">the 2008 semi-final</a> which, as it is on Saturday, was staged at the Ricoh Arena.</p> <p>Munster were then one of Europe’s leading forces, on their way to their fourth final that decade, while Saracens were just emerging from a long hibernation and not expected to mount much of a challenge. They confounded expectation and were a late drop-goal away from victory.</p> <p>Led by Paul O’Connell, Munster then brimmed with seasoned internationals, as Saracens do today. Their side are less celebrated now and, on paper, would not rank among the leading four in Europe. Yet the Champions Cup continues to bring out the very best in them, as they showed in their opening game this season when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/13/exeter-munster-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report" title="">securing a draw</a> at Exeter.</p> <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="6a4a579020230cc9d76c2a04cf36d0d7b3dcbd28"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/6a4a579020230cc9d76c2a04cf36d0d7b3dcbd28/0_194_4893_2936/1000.jpg" alt="Mako Vunipola training" width="1000" height="600" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Mako Vunipola will make his first start for Saracens since January.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <p>“I do not know exactly what it is with Munster when it comes to Europe,” Farrell said. “Guys who have been here for a while like Keith Earls and Peter O’Mahony are extremely hungry and when they come back from international camps, they change things massively. They have an aura and everything we do in a week like this is led by them. This team is different to those that went before and we cannot base ourselves on the past. We want to do something special together.”</p> <p>It may be a “home” game for Saracens but Munster are likely to have the majority of the spectators cheering them. They have long been the best supported team in Europe and it will be the third visit to England for their fans this season after the group trips to Exeter and Gloucester.</p> <p>“I guarantee it will not feel like a home game for Saracens,” Farrell said. “Our fans were just insane in the games at Exeter and Gloucester. When we walked around Kingsholm at the end of the match, the stands were full of Munster supporters. They travel from all over to support us. We can take a lot from those games against sides who are in the top three of the Premiership.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/18/the-breakdown-champions-cup-semi-finals-10s-rugby-union">The Breakdown | Return of the flamboyant fly-half: daring No 10s are back in fashion</a> </p> </aside> <p>“We had the mindset at Gloucester you need when you play away in Europe. We did not sit back but enforced our game on them, attacking in waves. A lesson of our last two semi-finals in Europe is that you cannot expect to be the better team. You have to force it from the start.”</p> <p>Mako Vunipola returns from injury to make his first start for Saracens since January and his brother Billy is at No 8 at the end of the week when he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/16/billy-vunipola-issued-formal-warning-rfu-israel-folau-homophobic-comment-rugby-union" title="">warned by club and country</a> for liking Israel Folau’s comments about sinners.</p> <p>Joey Carbery has failed to recover from a hamstring injury and the experienced Tyler Bleyendaal will partner Conor Murray at half-back for Munster.</p> <p>“We are aware of what has happened this week,” Farrell said. “We do not hide away from social media. We have seen the reaction he received but the matter has zero bearing on the semi-final. Our focus has been us.”</p>',

          trailText: "<strong>Editorial:</strong> The death of a young journalist at the hands of dissident republicans is a tragedy linked to the province’s ongoing political crisis",
          body: '<p>The murder of the 29-year-old Northern Irish journalist and author <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/lyra-mckee" title="">Lyra McKee</a> late last night is a tragedy for those who knew her. But her shooting, during rioting in Derry, is of political as well as terrible personal significance. There could hardly be a starker warning that while the Troubles may have officially ended with the Good Friday agreement 21 years ago, the risk of further violence remains.</p> <p>Ms McKee should have been part of the future. A self-described “ceasefire baby”, too young to have her own memories of the 1970s and 1980s, she brought curiosity and courage to her explorations of Northern Ireland’s history. Having grown up off a stretch of the Antrim Road in north Belfast known as the Murder Mile, she wrote about the sharp rise in suicides that came with peace and argued that trauma was part of her generation’s inheritance. But she was determined to rise above the sectarianism and narrow-mindedness of the past. Her investigation of children who vanished during the Troubles, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/lyra-mckee-lost-girl-of-the-troubles-1.3865869" title="">The Lost Boys</a>, is due to be published next year.</p> <p>She wrote and spoke powerfully of the impact of the homophobia that was part of her Catholic upbringing. In an open <a href="http://www.thepensivequill.com/2014/08/letter-to-my-14-year-old-self.html?m=0" title="">letter to her teenage self</a>, she described pleading with God for help when she realised she was a lesbian, and apologising when she told her mother. But far from turning her back on religion, or avoiding those who were intolerant, she believed in the value of difficult conversations, and urged others to seek out those who disagreed with them. She wanted to change religious teaching about sexuality; to help other young people.</p> <p>Police blame dissident republicans. When Saoradh, a party representing the New IRA’s thinking, claimed Ms McKee was the accidental victim of a “republican volunteer” seeking to defend the community from “heavily armed crown forces”, the backlash came from across the political spectrum. DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald appeared together at a vigil while Northern Irish parties issued a highly unusual joint statement condemning the attack on “peace and democratic processes”. </p> <p>Politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea now have the opportunity to address the broader political context in which grievances have festered, and violence has increased. Since the Stormont assembly collapsed in 2017, Northern Ireland’s political life has been suspended. While the immediate cause was an energy scandal, the crisis has been allowed to widen to the point where it becomes hard to see a way back to the power-sharing arrangement that is the only bridge to a peaceful future. </p> <p>Blame games between Sinn Féin and the DUP predated Theresa May’s confidence-and-supply arrangement with Ms Foster’s party. But the role of the DUP in propping up her government made a difficult situation worse. Mrs May’s failure to treat the situation with the seriousness it requires throughout the Brexit process has been compounded by ministers’ shocking ignorance and incompetence: former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab’s admission that he hadn’t read the Good Friday agreement; Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley’s assertion that killings by the security services were “not crimes”.</p> <p>Ms McKee’s death has resonated so widely because of her own<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/19/lyra-mckee-writer-murder-derry-northern-ireland" title=""> remarkable qualities</a>. But its timing reinforces the powerful warning it sends. The Good Friday agreement is precious, as the visit to Stormont by a US delegation led by Nancy Pelosi this week reaffirmed. But it could not, by itself, heal Northern Ireland’s divisions. Instead, it offered a way to manage them. That a young life has been cut short should remind politicians on all sides that the agreement cannot be taken for granted, and that if the urgent task is to safeguard it, the ultimate task must be to move beyond it. </p>',

          trailText: "<strong>Editorial:</strong> The long weekend is a rare chance for unmediated contact with the world and with our friends. Don’t miss it",
          body: '<p>Spring has come to the UK. The weather invites us to feel it on the skin and not through a window or a screen. Get out there into it, and go there without a phone – unless you’re walking in the mountains and might need to contact the emergency services. For the rest of us, being without a phone is not in itself an emergency, even though it might feel like one at first. Phones do provide us with helpful information all the time. They keep us oriented in the physical world, and position us in the social world, albeit while sharing all this with advertisers. But life was possible without them even as recently as 10 years ago, and sometimes it is worth a visit to that lost age when maps were made of paper and video was something people watched together.</p> <p>There are two reasons at least for trying to make time away from screens this bank holiday. The first is that it is, and ought to be, a true break from work. Anyone who works in an office knows now that email, messaging and phone calls mean that both the office itself and the people who want to deal with it can follow you anywhere, at any time. There is never a moment when you can feel that you have actually accomplished everything that could reasonably be expected.</p> <p>The German car company Daimler has an admirable <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/14/email-inbox-tyranny-out-of-office-reply-holiday" title="">holiday email</a> available to employees, which informs the sender that their email will be deleted; if it is really important please try a colleague or resend when the holiday is over. This will work largely because few things will still seem urgent in a fortnight’s time, and that is a message in itself worth remembering. There is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38479439" title="">a French law mandating</a> that large companies should have a policy allowing employees not to be chased by work email after office hours. </p> <p>These efforts are of course vulnerable to sabotage. Really ambitious people will never sign up to them and the less ambitious ones will feel obliged to keep up, since ambition and permanent discontent are meant to be virtues in a culture of non-stop productivity and side-hustles even when the day job is done. The paradox is that constant interruptions from email and other messages are just as disruptive of work as they are of everything else. An atmosphere of constant distraction, as if there were electronic toddlers tugging at your attention all day, <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-doesnt-use-facebook-anymore.html" title="">makes any kind of thoughtfulness more difficult</a>.</p> <p>This is just as true even for people who can summon the self-discipline needed to disconnect entirely from work when they have a holiday. The second reason for turning off phones at these times is that they so easily become fountains of distraction from and dissatisfaction with the world around us even when we’re supposed to be relaxing. When the phone is not demanding that we pay attention to the performance of others, it seems to demand that we perform our own emotions rather than experience them. Like the old-fashioned tourist’s camera, it swaps the immediacy of experience for an anticipation of its memory. The urge to share is sometimes the urge to show off.</p> <p>This weekend, put your phone down and leave it there a while. Grab the world with both hands instead and get them dirty: garden, make something, or cook a meal; eat without photographing it first. Lose yourself in the present around you.</p>',

          body: '<p>The warm weather drew a sell-out crowd of 10,000 here on Good Friday but any heavy-hitting punters in the stands went home disappointed after Matterhorn’s seven-length defeat of the hot favourite, Wissahickon, in the Easter Classic, the feature event on All-Weather Finals day.</p> <p>Wissahickon went to post having been beaten only twice in 10 starts and on a winning run that included three of the most significant races at Lingfield over the course of the winter campaign. As if the punters needed any further encouragement, he also had Frankie Dettori in his saddle and, though he had the worst of the draw in stall eight, he duly set off as the 1-3 favourite.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/18/paul-nicholls-3000-national-hunt-winners">Paul Nicholls becomes third National Hunt trainer to saddle 3,000 winners</a> </p> </aside> <p>Matterhorn, though, had an impressive record of his own on the all-weather until suffering an unexpected defeat at Kempton in late March. He was soon settled just behind the pacesetting Court House under Joe Fanning while Dettori was forced to race three wide on Wissahickon, and it was the Italian who was first to ask his mount to quicken on the turn for home.</p> <p>The response from Wissahickon was brief and limited. Matterhorn, on the other hand, still had plenty of running to give and he left Wissahickon trailing in his wake as he quickened clear in the straight. The odds-on favourite was second but only just as the 40-1 chance Pactolus closed all the way to the line.</p> <p>Mark Johnston, Matterhorn’s trainer, blamed a change of plan for the colt’s disappointing performance in his previous race. “It was a step up in class last time out,” Johnston said. “It was a diversion from the plan, as we thought we could take in a Listed race along the way. I think this is clearly a better performance. We thought long and hard if he was going to run over a mile [earlier on the card] or a mile and a quarter and we decided we shouldn’t run away from one horse [and] he was fantastic when he hit the front.</p> <p>“Once he started running on the all-weather and winning we always had this race in mind, and that was great to see. He’ll have to go into Pattern company now and it might be a different story but we’ll have to find out. I don’t think grass will be a worry.”</p> <p>John Gosden, Wissahickon’s trainer, pointed to his wide draw as a possible reason for his below-par performance but this was still many pounds behind his form from earlier in the winter.</p> <p>“He was three wide and had no cover all the way,” Gosden said. “Racing three wide from that draw, it’s tough round here when you meet the bend quick and you spend the whole way in the middle of the track. He is a cover-up, turn-of-foot horse. The draw has slightly done for him but that is life.”</p> <p>Favourite-backers had more to cheer in the Sprint Championship, where Kachy, at 4-9, went one better than last year from the front, and also the Three-Year-Old Championship, where Christophe Soumillon delivered the 11-4 market leader Pizzicato at the furlong pole apparently full of running but was forced to fight by Deputise before getting home by a short head.</p> <p>Pizzicato’s win was a first in Britain for his trainer, Fabrice Chappet, and also Soumillon’s first on Lingfield’s all-weather. “When he hits the front, he tends to stop,” Soumillon said, “and that is what he did today. I was lucky that I could keep close to the second as that kept him concentrated all the way to the line.”</p> <p>The huge crowd at Lingfield was a return to the sell-out of previous years after a disappointing turnout due to poor weather when Good Friday fell in late March last year. The meetings at Bath and Newcastle also saw big jumps in attendance with 10,500 passing through the turnstiles at the west country course, up from 5,000 in 2018, and 7,000 at Newcastle, up from 3,402 12 months earlier.</p> <figure class="element element-atom"> <gu-atom data-atom-id="63fd5695-395a-43af-a684-09f6810ffe2a" data-atom-type="guide"> <div> <div class="atom-Guide"> <p></p> <p><b>Lingfield&nbsp;</b><b>1.30 </b>Starlight Romance<b> 2.00 </b>Amade&nbsp;<b>2.30</b> Gorgeous Noora<b> 3.05 </b>Kachy&nbsp;<b>3.40 </b>Charming Kid (nb) <b>4.15 </b>Wissahickon&nbsp;<b>4.45</b> Straight Right (nap)&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Newcastle </b><b>1.40 </b>Lady Kermit <b>2.10 </b>Rocket Action <b>2.45 </b>Chosen World <b>3.20 </b>Bayroot<b> 3.55</b> Island Brave <b>4.25 </b>Smarter<b> 4.55 </b>Burford Brown&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Bath&nbsp;</b><b>1.50</b> The Cruising Lord <b>2.20 </b>Zulu Zander&nbsp;<b>2.55 </b>Robert L’Echelle <b>3.30 </b>Petrus&nbsp;<b>4.05 </b>One Last Night<b> 4.35 </b>Given Choice<b> 5.05 </b>Acclaim The Nation&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Tips by Greg Wood</i></p> <p></p> </div> </div> </gu-atom> </figure>',
